``` 
Scenario 1: Successfully updating an existing product
Details:  
  TestName: updateExistingProduct
  Description: This test ensures that an existing product can be updated with new values and verifies that the response contains the updated product details.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Product object with predefined values and a mock ProductRepository that returns the mock Product when findById is called.
  Act: Call the updateProduct method with the product ID and the updated Product object.
  Assert: Check that the ResponseEntity contains the updated product and the HTTP status is OK (200).
Validation: 
  Validate that the productRepository's save method is called with the updated product. Also, verify that the ResponseEntity body contains the updated product information, confirming that the update operation was successful. This test is significant as it confirms the primary functionality of the updateProduct method.
Scenario 2: Attempting to update a non-existent product
Details:  
  TestName: updateNonExistentProduct
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the updateProduct method when trying to update a product that does not exist in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock ProductRepository that returns an empty Optional when findById is called for a non-existent product ID.
  Act: Call the updateProduct method with a non-existent product ID and a Product object.
  Assert: Check that the ResponseEntity has a NOT_FOUND (404) status.
Validation: 
  Validate that the productRepository's save method is not called and that the response status is NOT_FOUND. This test is important because it verifies that the application correctly handles cases where an update operation is attempted on a product that does not exist.
Scenario 3: Updating a product with invalid input values
Details:  
  TestName: updateProductWithInvalidInput
  Description: This test ensures that updating a product with invalid input (such as a null name or price) is handled properly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Product object with invalid values (e.g., null name) and a mock ProductRepository that returns the mock Product when findById is called.
  Act: Call the updateProduct method with the product ID and the invalid Product object.
  Assert: Check that the ResponseEntity has a BAD_REQUEST (400) status or other appropriate error response.
Validation: 
  Validate that the productRepository's save method is not called with invalid input and that an appropriate error response is returned. This test is significant as it ensures the robustness of the application by handling invalid inputs gracefully.
Scenario 4: Updating a product with null values for non-mandatory fields
Details:  
  TestName: updateProductWithNullNonMandatoryFields
  Description: This test verifies that a product can be updated with null values for fields that are not mandatory (e.g., description).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Product object with null values for non-mandatory fields and a mock ProductRepository that returns the mock Product when findById is called.
  Act: Call the updateProduct method with the product ID and the Product object with null non-mandatory fields.
  Assert: Check that the ResponseEntity contains the updated product and the HTTP status is OK (200).
Validation: 
  Validate that the productRepository's save method is called with the updated product and that the response contains the updated product details. This test is important to ensure that the application allows updates to non-mandatory fields without throwing unnecessary errors.
Scenario 5: Updating a product with an empty body in the request
Details:  
  TestName: updateProductWithEmptyBody
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the updateProduct method when the request body is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock ProductRepository and simulate the scenario where the request body is empty (null Product object).
  Act: Call the updateProduct method with a valid product ID and a null Product object.
  Assert: Check that the ResponseEntity has a BAD_REQUEST (400) status or other appropriate error response.
Validation: 
  Validate that the productRepository's save method is not called when the request body is empty and that an appropriate error response is returned. This test is crucial to ensure that the application does not attempt to update a product without the necessary information.
