```
Scenario 1: Successfully update an existing product

Details:
  TestName: updateExistingProduct
  Description: This test verifies that an existing product can be successfully updated with new values for name, description, and price.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an Optional of an existing Product when findById is called with a valid ID, and to expect a save operation with the updated Product.
  Act: Call the updateProduct method with the valid ID and a Product object containing updated fields.
  Assert: Assert that the ResponseEntity returned has an OK status and the body contains the updated Product.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the product information is updated as expected and the response entity correctly reflects this. This test confirms that the update mechanism is functioning correctly for valid inputs and existing products.

Scenario 2: Attempt to update a non-existing product

Details:
  TestName: updateNonExistingProduct
  Description: This test ensures that attempting to update a product that does not exist returns a NotFound response.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an empty Optional when findById is called with an ID that does not correspond to any existing product.
  Act: Call the updateProduct method with a non-existing ID and a Product object.
  Assert: Assert that the ResponseEntity returned has a NotFound status.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the application responds appropriately when an update is attempted on a non-existing product by returning a NotFound status, which is crucial for maintaining data integrity and providing correct feedback to the client.

Scenario 3: Update product with null values

Details:
  TestName: updateProductWithNullValues
  Description: This test checks if the product can be updated when some or all of the product's fields (name, description, price) are null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an Optional of an existing Product when findById is called. Prepare a Product object with null values for some or all fields.
  Act: Call the updateProduct method with a valid ID and the Product object with null values.
  Assert: Assert that the ResponseEntity returned has an OK status and the body contains the updated Product with the null values as provided.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that products can be updated with null values where allowed by business rules. It is significant to verify that the application can handle partial updates and null values without throwing exceptions or errors.

Scenario 4: Update product with invalid ID type

Details:
  TestName: updateProductWithInvalidIdType
  Description: This test checks the behavior when the updateProduct method is called with an ID that is not of type Long.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an ID of a type other than Long and a Product object with valid details.
  Act: This step is not directly applicable as the method signature will not accept an invalid type, and the test will not compile.
  Assert: This step is not directly applicable as the test will not compile.
Validation:
  This is a compile-time scenario rather than a runtime test. The aim is to validate that the method signature enforces type safety, ensuring that only valid types are accepted for the ID parameter.

Scenario 5: Update product with negative ID value

Details:
  TestName: updateProductWithNegativeId
  Description: This test checks the behavior when the updateProduct method is called with a negative ID value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an empty Optional when findById is called with a negative ID value. Prepare a Product object with valid details.
  Act: Call the updateProduct method with a negative ID and the Product object.
  Assert: Assert that the ResponseEntity returned has a NotFound status.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that negative ID values, which are typically invalid, do not result in a successful update and that the application responds with a NotFound status, maintaining data integrity and proper error handling.

Note: The actual execution of tests would require a testing framework such as Mockito to mock the ProductRepository and a testing framework like JUnit to write and run the tests. The above scenarios are theoretical and assume the presence of such frameworks.
