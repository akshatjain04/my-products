Scenario 1: Successful Product Update

Details:
  TestName: updateProductWithValidId
  Description: This test checks that the product details are updated successfully when a valid ID is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Product object with updated details and a valid ID that exists in the productRepository. Set up the productRepository to return an Optional of the existing product when findById is called.
  Act: Call the updateProduct method with the valid ID and the mock Product object.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has a status code of OK (200) and the body contains the updated product details.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the response entity contains the correct status and updated product. This is important to confirm that the update operation is successful and the method behaves as expected when given valid input.

Scenario 2: Product Update with Non-Existent ID

Details:
  TestName: updateProductWithInvalidId
  Description: This test ensures that the correct response is returned when an attempt is made to update a product that does not exist in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Product object and a non-existent ID that the productRepository does not contain. Set up the productRepository to return an empty Optional when findById is called with the non-existent ID.
  Act: Call the updateProduct method with the non-existent ID and the mock Product object.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has a status code of NOT_FOUND (404).
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the method returns the appropriate response when a product with the provided ID does not exist. This test is crucial for handling cases where clients attempt to update non-existing resources, ensuring robust error handling.

Scenario 3: Product Update with Null Product Details

Details:
  TestName: updateProductWithNullDetails
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the updateProduct method when the provided product body is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a null Product object and a valid ID that exists in the productRepository. Set up the productRepository to return an Optional of the existing product when findById is called.
  Act: Call the updateProduct method with the valid ID and the null Product object.
  Assert: This is a tricky scenario as the method signature does not explicitly handle null for the @RequestBody. The test should verify the behavior of the method or the framework when null is passed -- whether it throws an exception or handles it gracefully.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify the method's robustness in handling null inputs. This test is significant in preventing potential null pointer exceptions and ensuring the application's stability.

Scenario 4: Product Update with ID as Null

Details:
  TestName: updateProductWithNullId
  Description: This test examines the response when a null ID is passed to the updateProduct method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Product object with updated details. Set up the productRepository to handle null values if necessary.
  Act: Call the updateProduct method with a null ID and the mock Product object.
  Assert: Verify the behavior of the method or the framework when null is passed as an ID -- whether it throws an exception or returns a bad request.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify how the method handles null ID values. This test is essential for ensuring that the application can handle unexpected input without crashing.

Scenario 5: Product Update with Negative ID

Details:
  TestName: updateProductWithNegativeId
  Description: This test verifies the method's response when a negative ID is used for updating a product.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Product object with updated details and a negative ID. Set up the productRepository to handle negative ID values, likely returning an empty Optional.
  Act: Call the updateProduct method with the negative ID and the mock Product object.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has a status code of NOT_FOUND (404).
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the method responds correctly to invalid ID input, such as negative numbers. This test is important for ensuring that the application does not attempt to look up or update products with IDs that cannot exist.

These scenarios cover a range of typical and edge-case behaviors that the updateProduct method should handle correctly.
