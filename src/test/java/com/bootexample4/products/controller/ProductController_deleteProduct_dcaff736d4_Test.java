Scenario 1: Successfully Delete an Existing Product
- Given an existing product with an ID in the database (e.g id = 1), when the deleteProduct function is called with this ID as a parameter, then the product should be successfully deleted from the database. Verify that the productRepository confirms that the product with the specified ID does not exist anymore, and that a 200 OK HTTP status response is returned.

Scenario 2: Attempt to Delete a Non-existing Product
- Given a product with an ID that is not in the database (e.g id = 999), when the deleteProduct function is called with this ID as a parameter, then no product should be deleted from the database (as it does not exist to begin with). Verify that the productRepository confirms that the product with the specified ID does not exist, and a 404 Not Found HTTP status response is returned.

Scenario 3: Attempt to Delete with a null ID 
- If the function deleteProduct is called with null as the id parameter, then no product should be deleted, as null is not a viable id. Verify that the productRepository does not delete any product and a 404 Not Found HTTP status response is returned.

Scenario 4: The Product Repository is Unreachable or Non-Operational
- If the productRepository is not available or not operational when  deleteProduct is called, then an error or exception will occur. This scenario would be dependent on how the productRepository handles these cases, but in general, an exception or error response should be expected and handled in the deleteProduct method.  

Scenario 5: Deleting a Product While Multiple Products Have Same ID
- Though this situation shouldn't arise in a relational database with constraints correctly defined, if it happens that multiple products with the same ID exist in the database, when the deleteProduct method is called with this ID, then we should verify if all the products having the same ID are deleted or only a single occurrence. It would depend on the underlying behavior of the "delete" method of the productRepository. 

Remember, the scenarios will mostly depend on your business specifications and constraints.
