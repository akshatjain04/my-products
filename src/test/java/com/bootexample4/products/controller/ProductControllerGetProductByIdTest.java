Scenario 1: Product found with valid ID

Details:
  TestName: getProductByIdWithValidId
  Description: Test to verify that the method returns the correct Product entity when a valid ID is provided that exists in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an Optional of a Product when findById is called with a valid ID.
  Act: Call the getProductById method with a valid ID.
  Assert: Check that the ResponseEntity contains the correct Product and has an OK status code.
Validation:
  Validate that the method returns a ResponseEntity with the expected Product and a 200 OK status code when a valid ID is passed. This test ensures that the method behaves correctly when a requested product is present in the system.

Scenario 2: Product not found with invalid ID

Details:
  TestName: getProductByIdWithInvalidId
  Description: Test to verify that the method returns a notFound response when an invalid ID is provided that does not exist in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an empty Optional when findById is called with an invalid ID.
  Act: Call the getProductById method with an invalid ID.
  Assert: Check that the ResponseEntity has a NOT_FOUND status code.
Validation:
  Validate that the method returns a ResponseEntity with a 404 NOT_FOUND status code when an invalid ID is passed. This test ensures the method correctly handles cases where the requested product is not found in the database.

Scenario 3: Product repository throws exception

Details:
  TestName: getProductByIdWhenRepositoryThrowsException
  Description: Test to verify that the method handles exceptions thrown by the productRepository gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to throw a RuntimeException when findById is called.
  Act: Call the getProductById method with any ID.
  Assert: Expect an exception to be thrown and handle it accordingly (e.g., return an appropriate error response).
Validation:
  Validate that the method is robust and can handle unexpected exceptions from the productRepository. This test ensures that the service remains stable even if the underlying data access layer encounters an issue.

Scenario 4: Product ID is null

Details:
  TestName: getProductByIdWithNullId
  Description: Test to verify that the method behaves correctly when null is passed as the ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is needed as the repository should not be called with a null ID.
  Act: Call the getProductById method with a null ID.
  Assert: Check that the ResponseEntity has a BAD_REQUEST status code or an appropriate error response.
Validation:
  Validate that the method returns a BAD_REQUEST or a suitable error response when null is passed as the ID. This test ensures that the method can handle invalid input gracefully.

Scenario 5: Product ID is negative

Details:
  TestName: getProductByIdWithNegativeId
  Description: Test to verify that the method behaves correctly when a negative ID is passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is needed as the repository should not be called with a negative ID.
  Act: Call the getProductById method with a negative ID.
  Assert: Check that the ResponseEntity has a BAD_REQUEST status code or an appropriate error response.
Validation:
  Validate that the method returns a BAD_REQUEST or a suitable error response when a negative ID is passed. This test ensures that the method can handle invalid input gracefully and conforms to expected input constraints.
