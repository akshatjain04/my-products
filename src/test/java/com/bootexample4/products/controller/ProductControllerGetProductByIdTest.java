ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getProductById_8904bc73fc

Scenario 1: Product found with the given ID

Details:
  TestName: getProductByIdWithValidId
  Description: This test will verify that the method returns the correct product details when a valid product ID is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an Optional containing a Product when findById is called with a valid ID.
  Act: Invoke the getProductById method with a valid ID.
  Assert: Assert that the ResponseEntity returned has a status of OK and the body contains the expected product.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that when a valid ID is provided, the method should return a ResponseEntity with a status of OK and the correct product. This is important to ensure that users can retrieve product details when they provide a correct product ID.

Scenario 2: Product not found for a given ID

Details:
  TestName: getProductByIdWithInvalidId
  Description: This test checks the method's behavior when an invalid or non-existing product ID is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an empty Optional when findById is called with an invalid ID.
  Act: Invoke the getProductById method with an invalid ID.
  Assert: Assert that the ResponseEntity returned has a status of NOT_FOUND.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the method should return a ResponseEntity with a status of NOT_FOUND when an invalid ID is provided. This test ensures the application handles non-existing products correctly, providing appropriate feedback to the user.

Scenario 3: Product repository throws an exception

Details:
  TestName: getProductByIdWhenRepositoryThrowsException
  Description: This test ensures that the method behaves as expected if the productRepository throws an exception when attempting to retrieve a product by ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to throw a RuntimeException when findById is called with any ID.
  Act: Invoke the getProductById method with any ID expecting exception handling.
  Assert: Expect an exception to be thrown or ensure that the method handles the exception appropriately.
Validation:
  The assertion would validate the method's robustness in handling unexpected exceptions from the productRepository. This is crucial for maintaining the reliability of the application in the face of potential database or system failures.

Scenario 4: Product ID provided is null

Details:
  TestName: getProductByIdWithNullId
  Description: This test checks the method's response when null is passed as the product ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is needed as the repository should not be called with a null ID.
  Act: Invoke the getProductById method with a null ID.
  Assert: Assert that the method returns a ResponseEntity with a status of BAD_REQUEST or that it handles the null ID appropriately.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the method should not accept null as a valid ID and should return an appropriate error response. This is important for preventing null pointer exceptions and ensuring API stability.

Scenario 5: Product ID provided is negative

Details:
  TestName: getProductByIdWithNegativeId
  Description: This test verifies the response of the method when a negative ID is provided, which is not a valid ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement with productRepository as negative IDs should not be considered valid.
  Act: Invoke the getProductById method with a negative ID.
  Assert: Assert that the method returns a ResponseEntity with a status of BAD_REQUEST or handles the negative ID appropriately.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the method should handle invalid input, such as negative IDs, by returning an appropriate error response or handling it gracefully. This helps maintain data integrity and prevents misuse of the API.
