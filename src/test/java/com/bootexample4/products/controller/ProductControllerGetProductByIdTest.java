Scenario 1: Product found with the given ID

Details:
  TestName: getProductByIdWithValidId
  Description: This test will verify that the method returns the correct product details when a valid product ID is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an Optional containing a Product when findById is called with a valid ID.
  Act: Invoke the getProductById method with a valid ID.
  Assert: Assert that the ResponseEntity returned has a status of OK and the body contains the expected Product.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that when a valid ID is provided, the method should return a ResponseEntity with a status of 200 OK and the correct product details. This is essential to ensure that users can retrieve product information as expected.

Scenario 2: Product not found with the given ID

Details:
  TestName: getProductByIdWithInvalidId
  Description: This test will check that the method returns a not found status when an invalid or non-existing product ID is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an Optional.empty() when findById is called with an invalid ID.
  Act: Invoke the getProductById method with an invalid ID.
  Assert: Assert that the ResponseEntity returned has a status of NOT_FOUND.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that when an invalid or non-existing ID is provided, the method should return a ResponseEntity with a status of 404 NOT_FOUND. This test is important to handle cases where the requested product does not exist, providing clear feedback to the user or calling service.

Scenario 3: Product repository throws an exception

Details:
  TestName: getProductByIdWhenRepositoryThrowsException
  Description: This test will check that the method handles unexpected exceptions thrown by the productRepository appropriately.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to throw a RuntimeException when findById is called.
  Act: Invoke the getProductById method with any ID.
  Assert: Assert that an appropriate exception is handled or propagated, depending on the desired behavior (this might require additional context on exception handling within the application).
Validation:
  This assertion checks the robustness of the method in handling unexpected failures. Ensuring that exceptions are handled properly is crucial for maintaining application stability and providing meaningful error messages to the user.

Scenario 4: Product ID is null

Details:
  TestName: getProductByIdWithNullId
  Description: This test will verify the method's behavior when a null ID is passed as an argument, which should ideally be prevented by the framework's routing mechanism but is still a potential edge case.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is necessary as the ID is null.
  Act: Invoke the getProductById method with a null ID.
  Assert: Assert that the appropriate exception is thrown or the correct response is returned based on the application's defined behavior for such cases.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the method does not break or return an incorrect response when faced with a null ID input. This test is significant in ensuring that the API has defensive checks against invalid inputs and behaves predictably.

These scenarios cover a range of typical and edge-case behaviors that the `getProductById` method could encounter during execution, ensuring comprehensive testing of the method's functionality.
