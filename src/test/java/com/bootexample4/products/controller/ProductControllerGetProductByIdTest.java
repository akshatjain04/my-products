```
Scenario 1: Successfully retrieve a product by valid ID

Details:
  TestName: getProductByIdWithValidId
  Description: This test ensures that when a valid ID is provided, the method returns the corresponding Product wrapped in a ResponseEntity with an OK status.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository.findById method to return an Optional containing a Product instance when a valid ID is passed.
  Act: Call the getProductById method with a valid ID.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has a status of OK and the body contains the expected Product.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that when a valid ID is provided, the product is retrieved successfully and the response status is OK. This test is significant as it verifies the method's ability to fetch a product by its ID correctly.

Scenario 2: Attempt to retrieve a product using an invalid ID

Details:
  TestName: getProductByIdWithInvalidId
  Description: This test checks that when an invalid ID is provided, the method returns a ResponseEntity with a NOT_FOUND status.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository.findById method to return an empty Optional when an invalid ID is passed.
  Act: Call the getProductById method with an invalid ID.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has a status of NOT_FOUND.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that a NOT_FOUND status is returned for an invalid ID, which is critical for handling cases where the requested product does not exist in the database.

Scenario 3: Retrieve a product when the ID is null

Details:
  TestName: getProductByIdWithNullId
  Description: This test verifies that when a null ID is provided, the method behaves as expected, potentially throwing an IllegalArgumentException or similar.
Execution:
  Arrange: Not applicable, as the method's path variable should not be null.
  Act: Attempt to call the getProductById method with a null ID and catch any resulting exception.
  Assert: Verify that an appropriate exception is thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that proper exception handling is in place for null ID inputs. This test is important to ensure the method's robustness and to prevent unexpected behavior.

Scenario 4: Database access error while retrieving a product by ID

Details:
  TestName: getProductByIdWithDatabaseError
  Description: This test simulates a scenario where there is a database access issue when attempting to retrieve a product by ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository.findById method to throw a DataAccessException when called.
  Act: Call the getProductById method with a valid ID and catch any resulting exception.
  Assert: Verify that a DataAccessException or a custom exception encapsulating it is thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the method handles database access errors gracefully. This test is significant as it checks the method's resilience and error handling in the face of database issues.

Scenario 5: Retrieve a product by ID when the repository returns an empty Optional

Details:
  TestName: getProductByIdWithEmptyOptional
  Description: This test ensures that when the repository returns an empty Optional, the method returns a ResponseEntity with a NOT_FOUND status.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository.findById method to return an empty Optional when a certain ID is passed.
  Act: Call the getProductById method with the ID that leads to an empty Optional.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has a status of NOT_FOUND.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the method correctly handles cases where the product is not found, returning a NOT_FOUND response. This test is essential for confirming the method's correct behavior when the requested product is absent from the repository.

/*
The test `getProductByIdWithNullId` is failing because the expected exception `IllegalArgumentException` is not being thrown when `productController.getProductById(null)` is called. The assertion error indicates that the test was expecting this specific exception to be thrown, but it did not occur, leading to the test failure.

The business logic implemented in the `getProductById` method of the controller uses the `findById` method of `productRepository`, which likely returns an `Optional<Product>`. When `null` is passed to `findById`, it does not throw an `IllegalArgumentException` but instead returns an `Optional.empty()`, which leads to the `ResponseEntity.notFound().build()` being returned. This behavior does not match the expectation set in the unit test, which is why the test is failing.

To fix this issue, one would need to either modify the business logic to throw an `IllegalArgumentException` when a `null` ID is passed or update the test to expect the correct response when `null` is passed to the `getProductById` method. However, it's worth mentioning that it is generally not a good practice to throw an `IllegalArgumentException` for a `null` ID in a REST controller method. Instead, the method should handle it gracefully, as it currently does by returning a 404 Not Found response, which is the correct behavior for a RESTful service when a resource is not found.
