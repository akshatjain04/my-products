```
Scenario 1: Deleting an existing product successfully

Details:
  TestName: deleteExistingProduct
  Description: This test ensures that when a valid product ID is provided, the product is successfully deleted from the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an Optional of a Product when findById is called with a valid ID.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with a valid product ID.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has an OK status code and that the delete method on the repository was called once.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the product is successfully deleted and the correct response is returned. This is significant as it confirms the API behaves correctly when removing existing products.

Scenario 2: Attempting to delete a non-existent product

Details:
  TestName: deleteNonExistentProduct
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the deleteProduct method when an invalid product ID is provided, which does not exist in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an empty Optional when findById is called with an invalid ID.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with an invalid product ID.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has a NOT_FOUND status code and that the delete method on the repository was not called.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures the API responds with a not found status when attempting to delete a product that does not exist. This test is significant for handling cases where clients attempt to delete resources that are no longer available.

Scenario 3: Deleting a product with null ID

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWithNullId
  Description: This test verifies that the deleteProduct method handles the case where a null ID is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is necessary as the repository method should not be called with a null ID.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with a null ID.
  Assert: Verify that a MethodArgumentTypeMismatchException is thrown or that the appropriate error handling is triggered.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the API handles null ID inputs gracefully and provides meaningful feedback. This test is important for robustness and to avoid unexpected behaviors or crashes in the application.

Scenario 4: Deleting a product when the repository is down

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWhenRepositoryIsDown
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the deleteProduct method when the product repository is not accessible.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to throw a DataAccessResourceFailureException when findById is called.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with any product ID.
  Assert: Verify that an appropriate exception is thrown or that the service returns an INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR response.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the API handles exceptions from the repository layer correctly and informs the client of issues on the server side. This test is crucial for maintaining stability and client trust when backend services fail.

Scenario 5: Deleting a product when the repository delete operation fails

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWhenDeleteOperationFails
  Description: This test ensures that the deleteProduct method handles failures during the delete operation gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return a valid product for findById, but throw an exception when delete is called.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with a valid product ID.
  Assert: Verify that an appropriate exception is thrown or that the service returns an INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR response.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the API communicates any issues during the delete operation to the client effectively. This test is important for error handling and to prevent leaving the client in an uncertain state regarding the operation's success.

/*
The unit test `deleteProductWithNullId` is expected to throw a `MethodArgumentTypeMismatchException` when `null` is passed to the `deleteProduct` method. The test is failing because the expected exception is not being thrown.

The `deleteProduct` method is designed to handle `null` values by using the `findById` method of the `productRepository`, which returns an `Optional`. When the `id` is `null`, `findById` does not throw a `MethodArgumentTypeMismatchException` but instead returns an `Optional.empty()`. The `deleteProduct` method then correctly handles this by returning `ResponseEntity.notFound().build()`. This means that the method is functioning as expected when given a `null` input and does not throw the exception that the test anticipates.

The `MethodArgumentTypeMismatchException` would typically be thrown by Spring MVC when a request is made with an incompatible type for a path variable, not by manual invocation of a controller method with incorrect parameter types. Since the test directly invokes the method and does not go through the Spring MVC request handling process, the exception is not thrown, leading to the test failure.

To correctly test the behavior of the `deleteProduct` method when faced with a `null` id, the test should expect a `ResponseEntity` with a `HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND` status rather than an exception.

	@Test
    @org.junit.experimental.categories.Category(Categories.integration.class)
/*
The provided unit test `deleteProductWhenRepositoryIsDown` is designed to simulate the scenario where the `productRepository` is down, and the `deleteProduct` method is called. The expected behavior is that the response should have an HTTP status of `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` (HTTP 500).

However, the test is failing because the actual `deleteProduct` method in the `ProductController` is not designed to handle exceptions thrown by the `productRepository`. When the `productRepository.findById` method throws a `DataAccessResourceFailureException`, the `deleteProduct` method does not catch this exception and instead propagates it up the call stack. This results in the test failing with an error rather than a failure because the expected behavior (HTTP 500 status) was not met.

To make the test pass, the `deleteProduct` method would need to be modified to include a try-catch block that catches `DataAccessResourceFailureException` (or a broader exception type if desired) and returns a `ResponseEntity` with the `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` status code.

As a proficient Java programmer and QA analyst, my recommendation would be to enhance the error handling in the `deleteProduct` method to properly handle exceptions from the `productRepository` and to ensure that the method returns an appropriate HTTP response status code when such exceptions occur. This change would align the business logic with the expectations set forth in the test case and result in the test passing.
@Test
@org.junit.experimental.categories.Category(Categories.integration.class)
public void deleteProductWhenRepositoryIsDown() {
    when(productRepository.findById(any(Long.class))).thenThrow(new DataAccessResourceFailureException(""));
    ResponseEntity<Object> response = productController.deleteProduct(1L);
    assertEquals(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR, response.getStatusCode());
}

	@Test
    @org.junit.experimental.categories.Category(Categories.integration.class)
/*
The test `deleteProductWhenDeleteOperationFails` is designed to verify the behavior of the `deleteProduct` method when the delete operation throws a `RuntimeException`. The test expects that when a `RuntimeException` is thrown during the delete operation, the `deleteProduct` method should return a response entity with the status code `HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`.

However, based on the error logs, the test is failing due to a `RuntimeException`, but not because the `deleteProduct` method is returning the wrong response entity. Instead, the `RuntimeException` is being thrown as part of the test setup where the `productRepository.delete` method is being mocked to throw a `RuntimeException`.

The `deleteProduct` method in the business logic handles the case when a product is not found by returning a `ResponseEntity.notFound().build()`, but it does not handle the case when the `delete` operation throws an exception. As a result, the actual `RuntimeException` thrown by the mock is not being caught or handled by the business logic, and it propagates up to the test, causing the test to fail.

To summarize, the test is failing because the business logic does not handle exceptions thrown by the `productRepository.delete` method. The expected behavior in the test, to return a response with `HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`, is not implemented in the `deleteProduct` method, and the unhandled `RuntimeException` from the mock is causing the test to fail.
@Test
@org.junit.experimental.categories.Category(Categories.integration.class)
public void deleteProductWhenDeleteOperationFails() {
    when(productRepository.findById(any(Long.class))).thenReturn(Optional.of(product));
    doThrow(new RuntimeException()).when(productRepository).delete(any(Product.class));
    ResponseEntity<Object> response = productController.deleteProduct(1L);
    assertEquals(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR, response.getStatusCode());
