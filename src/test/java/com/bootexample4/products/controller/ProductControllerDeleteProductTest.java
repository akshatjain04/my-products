ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=deleteProduct_65c62d8b91

Scenario 1: Successful product deletion

Details:
  TestName: deleteExistingProduct
  Description: This test verifies that the deleteProduct method successfully deletes a product when a valid ID is provided, and the product exists in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an Optional of a Product when findById is called with a valid ID.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with the valid ID.
  Assert: Verify that ResponseEntity.ok().build() is returned and that productRepository.delete is called once with the correct Product.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the correct ResponseEntity is returned, indicating a successful deletion. The validation of the repository's delete method call ensures the product is actually removed from the repository. This test is significant as it confirms the method's ability to handle the happy path correctly.

Scenario 2: Product not found for deletion

Details:
  TestName: deleteNonExistentProduct
  Description: This test ensures that the deleteProduct method returns the correct ResponseEntity when an ID is provided for a product that does not exist in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return Optional.empty() when findById is called with a non-existent ID.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with the non-existent ID.
  Assert: Verify that ResponseEntity.notFound().build() is returned.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the correct ResponseEntity is returned when a product is not found, which is essential for providing the client with the appropriate feedback. This test is important for validating the robustness of the method in handling cases where the product to be deleted does not exist.

Scenario 3: Delete product with null ID

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWithNullId
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the deleteProduct method when a null ID is passed as an argument, which should be handled gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is necessary as the repository method should not be called with a null ID.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with a null ID.
  Assert: Expect an exception to be thrown or a specific error handling response to be returned, depending on how the application is designed to handle such cases.
Validation:
  This test validates that the method handles null ID inputs correctly without causing a system failure, ensuring the application's stability. It's significant as it tests the method's resilience against invalid input scenarios.

Scenario 4: Repository throws exception during product deletion

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWhenRepositoryThrowsException
  Description: This test assesses the deleteProduct method's ability to handle exceptions that may be thrown by the productRepository during the deletion process.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to throw a RuntimeException when findById is called with any ID.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with an ID that would trigger the exception.
  Assert: Expect an appropriate error handling response, such as returning a ResponseEntity with an INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR status.
Validation:
  The test ensures that unexpected exceptions from the repository do not cause the service to fail and are handled appropriately, maintaining the service's reliability. It's crucial for testing the method's exception handling capabilities.
