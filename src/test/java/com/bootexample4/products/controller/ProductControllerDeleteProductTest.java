ROOST_METHOD_HASH=deleteProduct_032472106e
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=deleteProduct_65c62d8b91

Scenario 1: Successful product deletion

Details:
  TestName: deleteExistingProduct
  Description: This test verifies that the deleteProduct method successfully deletes a product that exists in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an Optional of a Product when findById is called with a specific ID.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with the ID of the product that exists.
  Assert: Verify that ResponseEntity.ok().build() is returned.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the correct response entity is returned upon successful deletion. It is significant because it confirms the method behaves as expected when a product is found and deleted.

Scenario 2: Product not found for deletion

Details:
  TestName: deleteNonExistingProduct
  Description: This test checks that the deleteProduct method returns the correct ResponseEntity when attempting to delete a product that does not exist in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an empty Optional when findById is called with a non-existent ID.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with an ID that does not correspond to any product in the repository.
  Assert: Verify that ResponseEntity.notFound().build() is returned.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies the response entity is correct when a product is not found. This is significant as it confirms the method handles the case of a non-existent product as expected by the application's business logic.

Scenario 3: Exception handling when repository operation fails

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductRepositoryException
  Description: This test ensures that the deleteProduct method handles exceptions thrown by the productRepository gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to throw a RuntimeException when findById or delete is called.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with any ID.
  Assert: Validate that an appropriate exception is thrown or a suitable ResponseEntity is returned.
Validation:
  The assertion checks how the method handles unexpected exceptions during database operations. The significance of this test is to ensure that the application remains robust and can handle failure scenarios gracefully.

Scenario 4: Deleting product with null ID

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWithNullId
  Description: This test ensures that the deleteProduct method handles the case where a null ID is passed as a parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is necessary as the ID is null.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with a null ID.
  Assert: Verify that an IllegalArgumentException is thrown or a ResponseEntity.badRequest().build() is returned.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the method handles null ID input correctly. This is significant for ensuring the method's contract is respected and that it can handle edge cases without causing unexpected behavior.

Scenario 5: Product is already deleted or concurrently deleted

Details:
  TestName: deleteAlreadyDeletedProduct
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the deleteProduct method when a product has been concurrently deleted by another operation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to first return an Optional of a Product, but to throw an exception or return a different result when delete is called.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with the ID of a product that is concurrently deleted.
  Assert: Verify that an appropriate response is returned, possibly indicating the product is no longer available.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the method can handle concurrent modifications to the data correctly. This is significant as it tests the method's robustness in a multi-user or concurrent access environment.

These scenarios cover a range of possible cases for the deleteProduct method, including successful deletion, handling of non-existent entities, exception handling, input validation, and concurrency issues. Each test is designed to validate a specific aspect of the method's functionality and ensure it meets the required business logic and robustness.
