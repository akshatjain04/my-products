```
Scenario 1: Successfully delete an existing product

Details:
  TestName: deleteExistingProduct
  Description: This test checks if the deleteProduct method successfully deletes a product that exists in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return a valid Product when findById is called with a specific id.
  Act: Call deleteProduct with the id of the product to be deleted.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has an OK status and the productRepository delete method was called once with the correct product.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the product is successfully deleted and the correct status is returned. This is important to ensure that the method handles the deletion of existing products correctly.

Scenario 2: Attempt to delete a non-existing product

Details:
  TestName: deleteNonExistingProduct
  Description: This test checks if the deleteProduct method returns the correct response when attempting to delete a product that does not exist in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return empty when findById is called with a non-existing product id.
  Act: Call deleteProduct with the id of a non-existing product.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has a NOT_FOUND status.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the method returns an appropriate response when a product with the given id does not exist. It is crucial for the method to handle cases where deletion is attempted on non-existing products to prevent errors.

Scenario 3: Deleting a product with a null id

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWithNullId
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the deleteProduct method when called with a null id.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is needed as the id is null.
  Act: Call deleteProduct with a null id.
  Assert: Expect an exception to be thrown due to the invalid argument.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the method throws the appropriate exception when provided with a null id, as it is essential for the method to handle invalid input arguments gracefully.

Scenario 4: Deleting a product when the repository operation fails

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWhenRepositoryOperationFails
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the deleteProduct method when the repository operation fails, such as due to a database error.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return a valid Product when findById is called, but make the delete operation throw an exception.
  Act: Call deleteProduct with the id of the product that causes the repository delete operation to fail.
  Assert: Verify that an appropriate exception is thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the method throws an exception when the repository operation fails. This is important to ensure that the method handles exceptions during the delete operation and does not leave the system in an inconsistent state.
