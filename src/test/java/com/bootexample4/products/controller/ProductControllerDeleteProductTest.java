ROOST_METHOD_HASH=deleteProduct_032472106e
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=deleteProduct_65c62d8b91

Scenario 1: Successful product deletion

Details:
  TestName: deleteExistingProduct
  Description: This test verifies that the deleteProduct method successfully deletes a product when a valid ID is provided and the product exists in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an Optional of a product when findById is called with a valid ID.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with the valid ID.
  Assert: Assert that the ResponseEntity returned has an OK status.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method returns an OK status when a product is successfully deleted. This is significant because it confirms the successful deletion of the product from the repository.

Scenario 2: Attempt to delete a non-existing product

Details:
  TestName: deleteNonExistingProduct
  Description: This test checks the deleteProduct method's response when attempting to delete a product with an ID that does not exist in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an empty Optional when findById is called with a non-existing ID.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with the non-existing ID.
  Assert: Assert that the ResponseEntity returned has a NOT_FOUND status.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method returns a NOT_FOUND status when a product with the given ID does not exist. This is important to confirm the method's correct behavior when dealing with non-existent resources.

Scenario 3: Product deletion when repository throws an exception

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWhenRepositoryThrowsException
  Description: This test ensures that the deleteProduct method behaves correctly when the productRepository throws an exception during the delete operation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return a valid product for findById and then throw a RuntimeException when delete is called.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with a valid ID that triggers the exception.
  Assert: Catch the exception and assert that it is an instance of the expected exception type.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that an exception is thrown when the repository fails to delete a product. This test is significant to ensure that the application can handle unexpected exceptions gracefully during the delete operation.

Scenario 4: Validate input for null ID

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWithNullId
  Description: This test checks the deleteProduct method's behavior when called with a null ID, expecting an IllegalArgumentException or similar error.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is necessary since the ID is null.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with a null ID.
  Assert: Assert that the appropriate exception is thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method throws an exception when called with a null ID. This test is important for validating input parameters and maintaining the integrity of the method's contract.

Scenario 5: Validate response entity body for successful deletion

Details:
  TestName: validateResponseEntityBodyForSuccessfulDeletion
  Description: This test ensures that the ResponseEntity body is empty upon successful deletion of a product.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an Optional of a product when findById is called with a valid ID.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with the valid ID.
  Assert: Assert that the ResponseEntity body is empty.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the ResponseEntity body is indeed empty after a successful deletion. This is important as the client should not receive any content in the response body for a DELETE request when it is successful.

Scenario 6: Repository method invocation validation

Details:
  TestName: verifyRepositoryDeleteMethodCalled
  Description: This test confirms that the productRepository's delete method is called when a product with a valid ID is found.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an Optional of a product when findById is called with a valid ID.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with the valid ID.
  Assert: Verify that the delete method on the productRepository is called exactly once.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the delete method on the productRepository is indeed being called. This verification is crucial to ensure that the method not only returns the correct ResponseEntity but also performs the expected operation on the repository.
