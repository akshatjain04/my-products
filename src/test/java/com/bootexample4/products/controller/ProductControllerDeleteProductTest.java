Scenario 1: Successful product deletion

Details:
  TestName: deleteExistingProduct
  Description: This test verifies that the deleteProduct method successfully deletes a product when a valid ID is provided and the product exists in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ProductRepository to return an Optional of Product when findById is called with a valid ID.
  Act: Call deleteProduct with the valid ID.
  Assert: Assert that the ResponseEntity returned has a status code of OK (200).
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that a product with the given ID was found and successfully deleted, resulting in an OK response. This test is significant because it ensures that the application can handle the standard use case of deleting an existing product.

Scenario 2: Attempt to delete a non-existent product

Details:
  TestName: deleteNonExistentProduct
  Description: This test checks that the deleteProduct method returns a NotFound response when trying to delete a product with an ID that does not exist in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ProductRepository to return an empty Optional when findById is called with a non-existent ID.
  Act: Call deleteProduct with the non-existent ID.
  Assert: Assert that the ResponseEntity returned has a status code of NOT_FOUND (404).
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that when a product with the given ID does not exist, the method responds appropriately with a NotFound status. This test is important for ensuring the robustness of the application in handling cases where the client attempts to delete a product that does not exist.

Scenario 3: Deletion with null ID

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWithNullId
  Description: This test ensures that the deleteProduct method handles cases where a null ID is provided, which should not happen since the path variable is expected to be non-null.
Execution:
  Arrange: None, as the request should not reach the controller method with a null ID.
  Act: This scenario is not applicable as the controller method should not be invoked with a null ID; it would be a case of invalid request handling at a higher level (e.g., Spring MVC).
  Assert: None, as this scenario is about request validation rather than method behavior.
Validation:
  This "test" is more of a thought exercise, as it reflects the need for proper request validation. It is not directly related to the deleteProduct method's functionality but rather to the framework's request handling mechanism. It is included to ensure that the application's endpoint is robust against malformed requests.

Scenario 4: Repository throws exception during deletion

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductRepositoryThrowsException
  Description: This test checks that the deleteProduct method behaves correctly if the ProductRepository throws an exception when trying to delete a product.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ProductRepository to throw a DataAccessException (or a suitable runtime exception) when delete is called.
  Act: Call deleteProduct with a valid ID that would trigger the exception.
  Assert: Assert that the appropriate exception is thrown or handled correctly (depending on application's global exception handling strategy).
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that unexpected repository behavior, such as database errors, is handled gracefully. This test is crucial for verifying the application's resilience and error handling capabilities when faced with runtime exceptions during data access operations.
