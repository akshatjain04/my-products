```
Scenario 1: Deleting an existing product successfully

Details:
  TestName: deleteExistingProduct
  Description: This test ensures that when a valid product ID is provided, the product is successfully deleted from the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an Optional of a Product when findById is called with a valid ID.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with a valid product ID.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has an OK status code and that the delete method on the repository was called once.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the product is successfully deleted and the correct response is returned. This is significant as it confirms the API behaves correctly when removing existing products.

Scenario 2: Attempting to delete a non-existent product

Details:
  TestName: deleteNonExistentProduct
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the deleteProduct method when an invalid product ID is provided, which does not exist in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an empty Optional when findById is called with an invalid ID.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with an invalid product ID.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has a NOT_FOUND status code and that the delete method on the repository was not called.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures the API responds with a not found status when attempting to delete a product that does not exist. This test is significant for handling cases where clients attempt to delete resources that are no longer available.

Scenario 3: Deleting a product with null ID

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWithNullId
  Description: This test verifies that the deleteProduct method handles the case where a null ID is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is necessary as the repository method should not be called with a null ID.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with a null ID.
  Assert: Verify that a MethodArgumentTypeMismatchException is thrown or that the appropriate error handling is triggered.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the API handles null ID inputs gracefully and provides meaningful feedback. This test is important for robustness and to avoid unexpected behaviors or crashes in the application.

Scenario 4: Deleting a product when the repository is down

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWhenRepositoryIsDown
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the deleteProduct method when the product repository is not accessible.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to throw a DataAccessResourceFailureException when findById is called.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with any product ID.
  Assert: Verify that an appropriate exception is thrown or that the service returns an INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR response.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the API handles exceptions from the repository layer correctly and informs the client of issues on the server side. This test is crucial for maintaining stability and client trust when backend services fail.

Scenario 5: Deleting a product when the repository delete operation fails

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWhenDeleteOperationFails
  Description: This test ensures that the deleteProduct method handles failures during the delete operation gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return a valid product for findById, but throw an exception when delete is called.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with a valid product ID.
  Assert: Verify that an appropriate exception is thrown or that the service returns an INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR response.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the API communicates any issues during the delete operation to the client effectively. This test is important for error handling and to prevent leaving the client in an uncertain state regarding the operation's success.
