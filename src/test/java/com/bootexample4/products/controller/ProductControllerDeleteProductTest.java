ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=deleteProduct_65c62d8b91

Scenario 1: Successful product deletion

Details:
  TestName: deleteExistingProduct
  Description: This test verifies that the deleteProduct method successfully deletes a product when a valid ID is provided and the product exists in the repository.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an Optional of the product when findById is called with a valid ID.
    Act: Call the deleteProduct method with the valid ID.
    Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has an OK status code.
  Validation:
    The assertion confirms that the product has been successfully deleted when the ID is valid. The test is significant because it ensures the method behaves correctly when attempting to delete an existing product.

Scenario 2: Product not found for deletion

Details:
  TestName: deleteNonExistingProduct
  Description: This test ensures that the deleteProduct method returns a NotFound response when an invalid or non-existing product ID is provided.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an empty Optional when findById is called with an invalid ID.
    Act: Call the deleteProduct method with the invalid ID.
    Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has a NOT_FOUND status code.
  Validation:
    The assertion checks that the appropriate response is returned when the product ID does not exist in the database. This test is important because it validates the method's error handling for non-existing entities.

Scenario 3: Exception handling during product deletion

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductExceptionHandling
  Description: This test ensures that the deleteProduct method handles exceptions properly if an error occurs during the deletion process.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the productRepository to throw a RuntimeException when delete is called.
    Act: Call the deleteProduct method with a valid ID that would trigger the exception.
    Assert: Verify that the method handles the exception and does not propagate it, instead returning an appropriate ResponseEntity.
  Validation:
    The assertion checks that the method is robust against exceptions during the deletion process. This test is critical to ensure the stability of the application and proper error handling.

Scenario 4: Product deletion with null ID

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWithNullId
  Description: This test checks the deleteProduct method's behavior when a null ID is passed as an argument.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is necessary as the repository should not be called with a null ID.
    Act: Call the deleteProduct method with a null ID.
    Assert: Verify that the method does not throw an IllegalArgumentException or any other exception.
  Validation:
    The assertion ensures that the method can handle null input gracefully. This test is important for ensuring that the application does not crash due to null input and adheres to fail-safe principles.
