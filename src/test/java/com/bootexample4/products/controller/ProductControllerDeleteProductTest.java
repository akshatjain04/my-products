```
Scenario 1: Product exists and is successfully deleted

Details:
  TestName: deleteExistingProduct
  Description: This test ensures that when a valid product ID is provided, the product is found and successfully deleted from the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return a non-empty Optional of a Product when findById is called with a valid ID.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with the valid product ID.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has a status of OK (200).
Validation:
  Assert that the ResponseEntity status is OK to confirm the product was found and deleted. This test is significant because it confirms the method behaves correctly when the product exists.

Scenario 2: Product does not exist and deletion is attempted

Details:
  TestName: deleteNonExistingProduct
  Description: This test checks the response when attempting to delete a product with an ID that does not exist in the product repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an empty Optional when findById is called with a non-existent product ID.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with the non-existent product ID.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has a status of NOT_FOUND (404).
Validation:
  Assert that the ResponseEntity status is NOT_FOUND to confirm that the product was not found and thus not deleted. This test is important to ensure the method handles cases where products do not exist in the repository.

Scenario 3: Repository throws exception during delete operation

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductRepositoryException
  Description: This test verifies that the method behaves correctly when the product repository throws an exception during the delete operation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return a valid Product when findById is called, but throw an exception when delete is called.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with a valid product ID.
  Assert: Expect an exception to be thrown during the test execution.
Validation:
  The test must confirm that an exception is properly handled (or propagated) by the deleteProduct method. This scenario is important to ensure robustness in the face of repository errors.

Scenario 4: Deleting a product with a null ID

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWithNullId
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the deleteProduct method when null is passed as the product ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: None, as the repository should not be called with a null ID.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with null as the product ID.
  Assert: Verify that an appropriate exception is thrown, such as IllegalArgumentException.
Validation:
  Assert that an exception is thrown to ensure the method does not accept null IDs and to prevent potential NullPointerExceptions. This test is significant for validating method input constraints.
