ROOST_METHOD_HASH=deleteProduct_032472106e
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=deleteProduct_65c62d8b91

Scenario 1: Successful product deletion

Details:
  TestName: deleteExistingProduct
  Description: This test verifies that the deleteProduct method successfully deletes a product when a valid ID is provided and the product exists in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an Optional of a Product when findById is called with a valid ID.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with the valid ID.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity has an OK status.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that when a product with the given ID exists, it can be deleted successfully. The OK status indicates that the operation was completed without errors.
  This test is significant as it ensures that the delete functionality works as expected for existing products.

Scenario 2: Product deletion with non-existing product ID

Details:
  TestName: deleteNonExistingProduct
  Description: This test checks if the deleteProduct method returns a NotFound response when attempting to delete a product with an ID that does not exist in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an empty Optional when findById is called with a non-existing ID.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with the non-existing ID.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity has a NOT_FOUND status.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that a NotFound response is returned when a non-existent product ID is used, indicating that the product could not be found for deletion.
  This test is important because it validates the method's error handling when a user tries to delete a product that does not exist.

Scenario 3: Product deletion with null ID

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWithNullId
  Description: This test ensures that the method handles null IDs gracefully and does not throw an exception or result in a server error.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to handle null inputs if necessary.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with a null ID.
  Assert: Assert that the appropriate exception is thrown or that a BadRequest response is returned.
Validation:
  The assertion checks the robustness of the method in handling invalid input (null) and ensures that the system remains stable without causing server errors.
  This test is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the application by preventing null input from disrupting the application flow.

Scenario 4: Product repository throws an exception

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWhenRepositoryThrowsException
  Description: This test scenario verifies that the deleteProduct method handles situations where the product repository operation throws an exception.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to throw a runtime exception when findById is called.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with an ID that triggers the exception.
  Assert: Assert that the appropriate exception is caught or that a server error response is returned.
Validation:
  The assertion checks the method's ability to handle unexpected exceptions during interaction with the product repository, ensuring that the application can gracefully handle repository errors.
  This test is significant as it ensures the reliability of the application in the face of unexpected errors during data access operations.
