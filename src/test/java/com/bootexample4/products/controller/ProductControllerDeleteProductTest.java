```
Scenario 1: Successfully delete an existing product

Details:
  TestName: deleteExistingProduct
  Description: This test checks if the deleteProduct method successfully deletes a product that exists in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an Optional of Product when findById is called with a specific ID.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with the ID of the product that exists.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity has an OK status.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that when a product with the given ID exists, it should be deleted and the method should return a ResponseEntity with an OK status. This is significant as it confirms the API's ability to delete products as expected.

Scenario 2: Attempt to delete a non-existent product

Details:
  TestName: deleteNonExistentProduct
  Description: This test checks if the deleteProduct method handles the case where an attempt is made to delete a product that does not exist in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an empty Optional when findById is called with a specific ID.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with the ID of a product that does not exist.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity has a NOT_FOUND status.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that when a product with the given ID does not exist, the method should return a ResponseEntity with a NOT_FOUND status. This test is significant because it ensures that the method responds correctly when a user tries to delete a product that is not in the database.

Scenario 3: Deleting a product with null ID

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWithNullId
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the deleteProduct method when called with a null ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is necessary as the method should handle null input.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with a null value for the ID.
  Assert: Assert that an appropriate exception is thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method should not accept null IDs and should throw an exception. This is significant as it ensures the robustness of the API by preventing null input from causing unexpected behavior.

Scenario 4: Deleting a product when the repository operation fails

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWhenRepositoryOperationFails
  Description: This test checks how the deleteProduct method behaves when there is a failure in the repository operation, such as a database connectivity issue.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository findById method to throw a RuntimeException when called.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with a valid ID.
  Assert: Assert that an appropriate exception is caught or a specific error response is returned.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the method should handle exceptions from the repository layer gracefully and should not propagate them. This is significant as it ensures that the API can handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback to the client.
