ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=deleteProduct_65c62d8b91

Scenario 1: Successful product deletion

Details:
  TestName: deleteExistingProduct
  Description: This test verifies that the deleteProduct method successfully deletes a product when a valid product ID is provided, and returns an OK response.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an Optional of a Product when findById is called with a valid ID.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with a valid product ID.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has an OK status code.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the status code is OK, confirming that the product was found and deleted successfully. This test is significant as it ensures that the method behaves correctly when the product to delete exists.

Scenario 2: Product not found for deletion

Details:
  TestName: deleteNonExistingProduct
  Description: This test checks that the deleteProduct method returns a NotFound response when an invalid product ID is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an empty Optional when findById is called with an invalid ID.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with an invalid product ID.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has a NOT_FOUND status code.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify the response status is NOT_FOUND when the product ID does not exist. This test is important to confirm that the method handles the case of a non-existent product correctly.

Scenario 3: Exception handling when deletion causes an error

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductExceptionHandling
  Description: This test ensures that the deleteProduct method handles any exceptions that may occur during the deletion process gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to throw a RuntimeException when delete is called.
  Act: Try to call the deleteProduct method with a valid product ID that triggers the exception.
  Assert: Verify that an appropriate exception is caught or a specific error response is returned.
Validation:
  This test does not have a direct assertion, as it is meant to ensure that exceptions are handled properly. It is significant because it ensures the robustness of the application in the face of unexpected errors during the deletion process.

Scenario 4: Delete product with null ID

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWithNullId
  Description: This test checks that the deleteProduct method handles null ID input appropriately without throwing an exception.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is needed as the ID is null.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with a null ID.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has a BAD_REQUEST status code or handles the null input gracefully.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the method does not throw an exception when provided with a null ID, which is important for the stability of the application. It checks that the system can handle invalid input without crashing.

Note: The BAD_REQUEST response is not part of the original method, but it is a common practice to handle null or invalid inputs. If the API is not designed to return BAD_REQUEST, the test should be adjusted to expect the actual behavior, such as throwing an IllegalArgumentException or a similar exception.
