ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=deleteProduct_65c62d8b91

Scenario 1: Successful product deletion

Details:
  TestName: deleteExistingProduct
  Description: This test verifies that the deleteProduct method successfully deletes a product when a valid product ID is provided, and returns an OK response.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an Optional of a Product when findById is called with a valid ID.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with a valid product ID.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has an OK status code and that the delete method on the productRepository was called once with the correct Product.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the product is deleted successfully and the correct response is returned. This is significant as it confirms the delete operation is functioning correctly within the application.

Scenario 2: Product not found

Details:
  TestName: deleteNonExistingProduct
  Description: This test ensures that the deleteProduct method returns a NotFound response when an invalid or non-existing product ID is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an empty Optional when findById is called with an invalid ID.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with an invalid product ID.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has a NotFound status code and that the delete method on the productRepository was not called.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the correct response is returned when a product is not found, which is important to handle cases where a client attempts to delete a non-existent product.

Scenario 3: Exception handling during product deletion

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductExceptionHandling
  Description: This test checks that the deleteProduct method handles exceptions thrown by the productRepository safely without propagating the exception.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository findById method to throw a RuntimeException when called.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with an ID that triggers the exception.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned is not OK or NotFound and that the delete method on the productRepository was not called.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the method handles exceptions gracefully and does not break the application flow, which is crucial for maintaining robustness in the face of unexpected repository errors.

Scenario 4: Product ID is null

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWithNullId
  Description: This test ensures that the deleteProduct method behaves correctly when called with a null ID, which should not happen in normal operation but is a possible edge case.
Execution:
  Arrange: There is no need to mock anything since the method will not reach the repository layer with a null ID.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with a null ID.
  Assert: Verify that an appropriate exception is thrown or that the method returns a BadRequest response.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the application handles null ID input correctly, which is important for preventing null pointer exceptions and ensuring application stability.
