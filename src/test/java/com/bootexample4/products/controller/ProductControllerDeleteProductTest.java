```
Scenario 1: Product exists and is successfully deleted
Details:
  TestName: deleteExistingProduct
  Description: This test verifies that a product with a valid ID is successfully deleted from the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create and save a Product object with a specific ID in the ProductRepository mock.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with the existing Product ID.
  Assert: Check that the ResponseEntity returned has an OK status and that the product is no longer in the repository.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the status is OK, indicating a successful deletion. It also verifies that the product is indeed deleted, ensuring the method behaves as expected when a valid product ID is provided.
Scenario 2: Product does not exist and deletion is attempted
Details:
  TestName: deleteNonExistingProduct
  Description: This test checks the scenario where a deletion is attempted on a non-existing product ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure the ProductRepository mock does not contain a Product with the given ID.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with a non-existing Product ID.
  Assert: Check that the ResponseEntity returned has a NOT_FOUND status.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the correct status is returned for a non-existing product, demonstrating the method's correct behavior in handling cases where the product to be deleted does not exist.
Scenario 3: Product ID is null when trying to delete a product
Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWithNullId
  Description: This test ensures that the method handles null IDs gracefully and does not throw an exception.
Execution:
  Arrange: Call the deleteProduct method with a null ID without setting up any Product in the repository.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with a null ID.
  Assert: Check that an appropriate exception is thrown or a NOT_FOUND status is returned.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method does not break and appropriately handles the case when a null ID is passed, which is important for the robustness of the application.
Scenario 4: Error occurs during the deletion process in the repository
Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWithErrorDuringDeletion
  Description: This test checks the method's robustness when an unexpected error occurs during the deletion process within the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the ProductRepository mock to throw a RuntimeException when the delete method is called.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with a valid product ID.
  Assert: Check that the appropriate exception is caught or an error status is returned.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the method can handle unexpected repository errors without crashing the application, which is crucial for maintaining the application's reliability.
Scenario 5: ProductRepository is empty, and deletion is attempted
Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWhenRepositoryIsEmpty
  Description: This test checks the behavior when an attempt is made to delete a product from an empty repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure the ProductRepository mock is empty.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with any product ID.
  Assert: Check that the ResponseEntity returned has a NOT_FOUND status.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that a NOT_FOUND status is returned when trying to delete from an empty repository, indicating the method correctly handles the scenario of an empty data set.
