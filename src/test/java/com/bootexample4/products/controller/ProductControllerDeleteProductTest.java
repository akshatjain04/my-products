```
Scenario 1: Deleting an existing product successfully
Details:
  TestName: deleteExistingProduct
  Description: This test ensures that when a valid product ID is provided, the product is successfully deleted from the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an Optional of a product when findById is called with a valid ID.
  Act: Call deleteProduct with the mocked valid ID.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has a status of OK (HTTP 200).
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. Here, we expect a successful deletion to result in an HTTP 200 status code, indicating that the operation was successful.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic. This test confirms that the delete operation functions correctly for existing records.
Scenario 2: Attempting to delete a product that does not exist
Details:
  TestName: deleteNonExistingProduct
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the deleteProduct method when an ID is provided for a product that does not exist in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an empty Optional when findById is called with a non-existing ID.
  Act: Call deleteProduct with the mocked non-existing ID.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has a status of NOT_FOUND (HTTP 404).
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. We expect a NOT_FOUND status code when trying to delete a non-existing product, as there is nothing to delete.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic. This test ensures that the application correctly handles attempts to delete non-existing resources.
Scenario 3: Deleting a product with a null ID
Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWithNullId
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the deleteProduct method when a null ID is passed as an argument.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A (since the repository method should not be called with a null ID).
  Act: Call deleteProduct with a null ID.
  Assert: Verify that an exception is thrown or a ResponseEntity with a BAD_REQUEST (HTTP 400) status is returned.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. An ID should not be null, so we expect the application to handle this case properly, either by throwing an exception or returning a BAD_REQUEST status.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic. This test checks that the application is robust against invalid input.
Scenario 4: Deleting a product with a negative ID
Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWithNegativeId
  Description: This test evaluates the behavior of the deleteProduct method when a negative ID is provided, which is considered invalid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an empty Optional when findById is called with a negative ID.
  Act: Call deleteProduct with the mocked negative ID.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has a status of NOT_FOUND (HTTP 404).
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. Even though a negative ID is not a valid ID, the method should still handle it gracefully by returning a NOT_FOUND status.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic. This test ensures that the application can handle edge cases with invalid input gracefully.
Scenario 5: Deleting a product when the repository delete operation fails
Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWhenRepositoryDeleteFails
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the deleteProduct method when the repository's delete operation fails (e.g., due to a database error).
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return a valid product for findById and then throw an exception when delete is called.
  Act: Call deleteProduct with a valid product ID.
  Assert: Verify that an appropriate exception is thrown or a ResponseEntity with an error status (e.g., INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR) is returned.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. We expect the application to handle repository operation failures gracefully and communicate the failure to the client.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic. This test ensures that the application is resilient and can handle unexpected failures during database operations.
