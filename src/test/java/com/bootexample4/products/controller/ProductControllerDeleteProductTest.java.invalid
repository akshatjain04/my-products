ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=deleteProduct_65c62d8b91
``` 
Scenario 1: Product exists and is successfully deleted
Details:
  TestName: deleteExistingProduct
  Description: This test ensures that when a valid product ID is provided, the product is found and successfully deleted from the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return a non-empty Optional of a Product when findById is called with a valid ID, and to expect a delete call with the same Product.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with the valid product ID.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has an OK status code.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the product is deleted successfully, which is indicated by an OK status code. This test validates the normal behavior of the method when a product is found and needs to be deleted.
Scenario 2: Product does not exist and deletion is attempted
Details:
  TestName: deleteNonExistingProduct
  Description: This test checks that when an invalid or non-existing product ID is provided, the method returns a NotFound response entity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an empty Optional when findById is called with a non-existing ID.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with the non-existing product ID.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has a NOT_FOUND status code.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly handles the case where the product does not exist. The expected result is a NOT_FOUND status code, signifying that the product could not be found for deletion. This test is important to ensure that the method handles error scenarios gracefully.
Scenario 3: Product ID is null and deletion is attempted
Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWithNullId
  Description: This test ensures that when a null is passed as the product ID, the method treats it as a bad request or an error scenario.
Execution:
  Arrange: None, as the repository should not be called with a null ID.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with a null ID.
  Assert: Verify that the method throws an appropriate exception or returns a suitable error response.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method handles null ID inputs correctly. The expected behavior is not explicitly defined in the method, so the test should define what the expected outcome is, whether it's an exception or a specific error response. This test is significant for the robustness of the application, ensuring that edge cases are handled without causing runtime errors.
Scenario 4: ProductRepository throws an exception during deletion
Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWhenRepositoryThrowsException
  Description: This test checks that the method handles exceptions thrown by the ProductRepository gracefully and returns an appropriate error response.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to throw a RuntimeException when delete is called.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with a valid product ID that triggers the exception.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has an appropriate error status code or that an exception is handled properly.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method can handle unexpected exceptions during the interaction with the repository. The expected result is an error status code or an exception response, ensuring that the method does not propagate unhandled exceptions. This test is crucial for maintaining the reliability of the application in the face of unexpected errors.
