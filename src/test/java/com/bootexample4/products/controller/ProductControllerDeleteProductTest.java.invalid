ROOST_METHOD_HASH=deleteProduct_032472106e
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=deleteProduct_65c62d8b91
``` 
Scenario 1: Product exists and is successfully deleted
Details:
  TestName: deleteExistingProduct
  Description: This test ensures that when a valid product ID is provided, the product is found and successfully deleted from the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return a non-empty Optional of a Product when findById is called with a valid ID, and to expect a delete call with the same Product.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with the valid product ID.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has an OK status code.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the product is deleted successfully, which is essential for maintaining data integrity and ensuring the application behaves as expected when users try to delete existing products.
Scenario 2: Product does not exist and deletion is attempted
Details:
  TestName: deleteNonExistingProduct
  Description: This test checks that when an invalid product ID is provided, the product is not found and a NotFound response is returned.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an empty Optional when findById is called with an invalid ID.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with the invalid product ID.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has a NOT_FOUND status code.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the system correctly handles cases where deletion is attempted on a non-existing product, which is crucial for providing accurate feedback to the user and preventing data corruption.
Scenario 3: Product ID is null and deletion is attempted
Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWithNullId
  Description: This test verifies that when a null product ID is provided, the method handles it gracefully and returns a BadRequest response.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement since the method should handle null IDs without interacting with the productRepository.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with a null ID.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has a BAD_REQUEST status code.
Validation:
  The assertion checks the robustness of the method in handling null inputs, which is important to prevent null pointer exceptions and to maintain reliable service operation.
Scenario 4: ProductRepository throws an exception during the deletion process
Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWhenRepositoryThrowsException
  Description: This test ensures that if the productRepository throws an exception while attempting to delete a product, the method handles it and returns an appropriate response.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to throw a RuntimeException when delete is called.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with a valid product ID that triggers the exception.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has an INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR status code.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the method properly handles unexpected exceptions during the deletion process, which is vital for maintaining application stability and providing meaningful error messages to the user.
