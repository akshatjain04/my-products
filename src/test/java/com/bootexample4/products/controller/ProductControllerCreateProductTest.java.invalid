``` 
Scenario 1: Successfully creating a new product

Details:  
  TestName: createValidProduct
  Description: This test ensures that a valid product can be successfully created and saved in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product object with valid details.
  Act: Call the createProduct method with the Product object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned Product object is not null and has the expected properties.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that the product returned from the method has the same properties as the one that was saved, confirming that the repository's save method is functioning correctly. This test is significant because it validates the happy path of product creation.

Scenario 2: Attempt to create a product with null value

Details:  
  TestName: createProductWithNullValue
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the createProduct method when a null product is passed as an argument.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the Product object to null.
  Act: Call the createProduct method with a null Product object.
  Assert: Expect an exception to be thrown, indicating that a product cannot be null.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the application correctly handles null product inputs by throwing an exception, which is important to prevent null reference errors in the application.

Scenario 3: Creating a product with incomplete details

Details:  
  TestName: createProductWithIncompleteDetails
  Description: This test checks how the createProduct method handles product objects with missing required fields.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product object with some required fields missing.
  Act: Call the createProduct method with the incomplete Product object.
  Assert: Expect an exception or an error response indicating that some product details are missing.
Validation: 
  The assertion ensures that the application enforces the integrity of the product data and that all necessary fields are present before saving the product. This test is significant for maintaining data quality.

Scenario 4: Creating a product with an already existing ID

Details:  
  TestName: createProductWithExistingId
  Description: This test verifies the createProduct method's behavior when a product with an existing ID is attempted to be created.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product object with an ID that already exists in the product repository.
  Act: Call the createProduct method with the Product object.
  Assert: Expect an exception or a specific error response indicating that the product ID is not unique.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that the application prevents the creation of products with duplicate IDs, which is crucial for maintaining the uniqueness of each product in the repository.

Scenario 5: Creating a product when the repository is down

Details:  
  TestName: createProductWhenRepositoryIsDown
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the createProduct method when the product repository is not accessible.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to simulate a scenario where the repository is down or unreachable.
  Act: Call the createProduct method with a valid Product object.
  Assert: Expect an exception or an error response indicating that the product cannot be saved due to repository issues.
Validation: 
  The assertion ensures that the application can gracefully handle situations when the product repository is unavailable, which is important for robustness and error handling in the application.
