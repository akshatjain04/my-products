``` 
Scenario 1: Successfully creating a new product
Details:  
  TestName: createProductWithValidData
  Description: This test checks if a product with valid data can be successfully created and persisted in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product object with valid details. Mock the productRepository to return the same product when save is called.
  Act: Call createProduct with the mock product object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned product matches the one passed in and ensure that save was called on the repository with the correct product.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the createProduct method returns the correct product object. This is significant because it confirms that the controller correctly interacts with the repository to persist and return the new product.
Scenario 2: Creating a product with null values
Details:  
  TestName: createProductWithNullValues
  Description: This test checks how the createProduct method handles null values in product fields that shouldn't be null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product object with null values in fields that are required. Mock the productRepository to handle null appropriately, if necessary.
  Act: Call createProduct with the product object containing null values.
  Assert: Verify that the appropriate exception is thrown or that the method handles the null values gracefully.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that an exception is thrown or an appropriate response is given when trying to create a product with invalid (null) data. This is important to ensure data integrity and prevent application crashes due to null values being persisted.
Scenario 3: Handling of repository exceptions during product creation
Details:  
  TestName: createProductWithRepositoryException
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of createProduct when the productRepository throws an exception during the save operation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product object with valid data. Mock the productRepository to throw a RuntimeException when save is called.
  Act: Call createProduct and expect an exception.
  Assert: Verify that the expected exception is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion ensures that the createProduct method can handle exceptions from the repository layer properly. This is crucial for the robustness of the application, as it needs to gracefully handle failures in the persistence layer.
Scenario 4: Creating a product with empty or blank fields
Details:  
  TestName: createProductWithEmptyFields
  Description: This test checks the behavior of createProduct when provided with a product object that has empty or blank string fields where it's not allowed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product object with empty or blank string fields. Mock the productRepository save method as needed.
  Act: Call createProduct with the product object.
  Assert: Verify that the method handles the input as expected, which might include validation errors or exceptions.
Validation: 
  The assertion confirms that the application validates input data and prevents the creation of products with invalid (empty or blank) fields. This is important for maintaining data quality and enforcing business rules.
Scenario 5: Creating a product with invalid field values
Details:  
  TestName: createProductWithInvalidFieldValues
  Description: This test checks if the createProduct method validates the product fields against any business rules (e.g., name not being a certain value, price not negative).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product object with invalid field values according to business rules. Mock the productRepository to behave as needed.
  Act: Call createProduct with the invalid product object.
  Assert: Verify that the method does not allow the creation of the product and handles the situation appropriately.
Validation: 
  The assertion confirms that the application enforces business rules on the data being saved. This is important to prevent the persistence of invalid data that could lead to business logic errors or unexpected behavior.
