``` 
Scenario 1: Successfully creating a new product
Details:  
  TestName: createProductWithValidData
  Description: This test checks if a product with valid data can be successfully created and persisted in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product object with valid details. Mock the productRepository to return the same product when save is called.
  Act: Call createProduct with the mock product object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned product matches the one passed in and that productRepository.save was called with the correct product.
Validation: 
  The assertion confirms that the method returns the correct product instance, indicating that the product was successfully created. This is significant because it confirms the create operation's functionality within the application.
Scenario 2: Attempting to create a product with null data
Details:  
  TestName: createProductWithNullData
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the createProduct method when null is passed in as the product.
Execution:
  Arrange: Pass null as the product to the createProduct method.
  Act: Invoke createProduct with a null argument.
  Assert: Expect an exception to be thrown due to the null input.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method handles null input appropriately, throwing an exception to prevent null entries in the repository. This is important for maintaining data integrity within the application.
Scenario 3: Repository throws an exception while saving a product
Details:  
  TestName: createProductRepositoryThrowsException
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the createProduct method when the productRepository throws an exception during the save operation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product object with valid details. Mock the productRepository to throw an exception when save is called.
  Act: Call createProduct with the mock product object.
  Assert: Expect an exception to be thrown, indicating a failure in the persistence layer.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that the method properly propagates exceptions from the persistence layer, which is crucial for error handling and notifying the caller of the failure in the product creation process.
Scenario 4: Creating a product with incomplete data
Details:  
  TestName: createProductWithIncompleteData
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the createProduct method when a product with incomplete or invalid data is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product object with missing or invalid details. Mock the productRepository to handle the save operation as per configuration.
  Act: Call createProduct with the incomplete product object.
  Assert: Verify that the appropriate validation mechanism is triggered, resulting in an error or exception.
Validation: 
  The assertion ensures that the method does not accept incomplete or invalid product data, which is essential for maintaining the quality and consistency of data in the repository.
Scenario 5: Creating a product with existing ID
Details:  
  TestName: createProductWithExistingId
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the createProduct method when trying to create a product with an ID that already exists in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product object with an ID that is known to exist. Mock the productRepository to return a conflict or error when the product with the same ID is being saved.
  Act: Call createProduct with the product object containing the existing ID.
  Assert: Verify that the method handles the conflict appropriately, possibly by throwing an exception or returning an error response.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method prevents the creation of a product with a duplicate ID, which is essential to avoid data integrity issues in the repository.
