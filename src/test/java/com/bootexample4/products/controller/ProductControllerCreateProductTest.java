Scenario 1: Test to check if product is created successfully

Details:
  TestName: testProductCreationSuccess.
  Description: This test is meant to check the successful creation of a product. The functionality being tested is the saving of a product in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock product and a mock productRepository. Set the productRepository to return the mock product when save method is called.
  Act: Invoke the createProduct method with the mock product.
  Assert: Assert that the returned product from the createProduct method is the same as the mock product.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the product is being saved correctly in the repository. The expected result is that the product returned from the method is the same as the product that was saved. This test is significant in ensuring that the application can successfully create and save products.

Scenario 2: Test to check if null product is handled correctly

Details:
  TestName: testNullProductCreation.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly handles a null product. The functionality being tested is the error handling when a null product is passed to the method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock productRepository. Do not create a mock product.
  Act: Invoke the createProduct method with null.
  Assert: Assert that an exception is thrown.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the method handles null inputs correctly by throwing an exception. The expected result is that an exception is thrown when a null product is passed to the method. This test is significant in ensuring that the application can handle errors correctly.

Scenario 3: Test to check if product with existing ID is handled correctly

Details:
  TestName: testProductCreationWithExistingId.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly handles a product with an existing ID. The functionality being tested is the error handling when a product with an existing ID is passed to the method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock product and a mock productRepository. Set the productRepository to return the mock product when save method is called. Set the product to have an ID that already exists in the repository.
  Act: Invoke the createProduct method with the mock product.
  Assert: Assert that an exception is thrown.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the method handles products with existing IDs correctly by throwing an exception. The expected result is that an exception is thrown when a product with an existing ID is passed to the method. This test is significant in ensuring that the application can handle errors correctly.
