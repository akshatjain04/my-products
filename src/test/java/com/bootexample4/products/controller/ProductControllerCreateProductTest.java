```
Scenario 1: Successful product creation

Details:
  TestName: createValidProduct
  Description: This test ensures that a valid product can be created and saved to the repository successfully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Product object with valid attributes and mock the productRepository to return the same product upon saving.
  Act: Call the createProduct method with the mock Product object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned Product is the same as the mock Product and that productRepository.save was called once with the mock Product.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method returns the correct Product instance, confirming that the save operation is successful. This test is significant as it validates the main functionality of the createProduct method, ensuring that it integrates correctly with the ProductRepository to save new products.

Scenario 2: Product creation with null product

Details:
  TestName: createProductWithNull
  Description: This test checks how the createProduct method handles the scenario when a null product is passed to it.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to expect a null value and define the behavior accordingly, if necessary.
  Act: Call the createProduct method with a null value.
  Assert: Verify that an appropriate exception is thrown or an error response is returned.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the method does not accept null values and handles them appropriately, either by throwing an exception or returning an error response. It is significant because it tests the robustness of the method against invalid input.

Scenario 3: Product creation with incomplete product details

Details:
  TestName: createProductWithIncompleteDetails
  Description: This test ensures that the createProduct method validates the product information and handles cases where product details are incomplete.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Product object with missing required attributes and mock the productRepository to handle saving appropriately.
  Act: Call the createProduct method with the incomplete Product object.
  Assert: Verify that an appropriate validation exception is thrown or an error response is returned.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the method enforces the integrity of the product data and rejects incomplete products. This test is important for maintaining data quality and preventing invalid data from being saved to the repository.

Scenario 4: Product creation with duplicate product details

Details:
  TestName: createProductWithDuplicateDetails
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the createProduct method when a product with details that conflict with existing entries in the repository is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Product object with attributes that would conflict with existing products and mock the productRepository to simulate a duplicate entry scenario.
  Act: Call the createProduct method with the mock Product object.
  Assert: Verify that a duplicate entry exception or an error response is returned.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the method prevents duplicate product entries, maintaining database integrity and enforcing business rules. This test is crucial for avoiding data duplication issues in the repository.

Scenario 5: Product creation with repository failure

Details:
  TestName: createProductWithRepositoryFailure
  Description: This test simulates a repository failure during the product creation process to check the robustness of the createProduct method in handling such cases.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Product object with valid attributes and mock the productRepository to throw an exception upon calling save.
  Act: Call the createProduct method with the mock Product object.
  Assert: Verify that the same exception is thrown or an error response is handled correctly.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the method can handle repository failures gracefully, either by propagating the exception or returning a meaningful error response. This test is significant for ensuring the reliability of the product creation process in the face of underlying repository issues.
