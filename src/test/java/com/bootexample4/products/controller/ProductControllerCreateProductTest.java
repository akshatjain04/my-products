```
Scenario 1: Successful product creation

Details:
  TestName: createValidProduct
  Description: This test ensures that a valid product can be created and saved to the repository successfully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Product object with valid attributes and mock ProductRepository to expect a save operation.
  Act: Call the createProduct method with the mock Product object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned Product is the same as the one passed in and that the save method on the repository was called.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the Product returned by the method is the same as the mock Product, confirming that the save operation was successful. This test is significant because it confirms the primary functionality of the createProduct method.

Scenario 2: Product creation with null product

Details:
  TestName: createNullProduct
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the createProduct method when a null product is passed as an argument.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock ProductRepository without specific expectations.
  Act: Call the createProduct method with a null value.
  Assert: Expect an exception to be thrown or a specific error response.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the method handles null inputs gracefully, either by throwing an exception or returning an appropriate response. This test is significant to prevent null pointer exceptions in the product creation process.

Scenario 3: Product repository throws exception

Details:
  TestName: createProductRepositoryException
  Description: This test verifies that the createProduct method behaves correctly when the ProductRepository save operation throws an exception.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Product object with valid attributes and mock ProductRepository to throw an exception when save is called.
  Act: Call the createProduct method with the mock Product object.
  Assert: Expect an exception to be thrown or a specific error response.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the createProduct method is robust and handles exceptions from the repository layer appropriately. This test is significant to ensure reliability and proper error handling in the product creation process.

Scenario 4: Product creation with incomplete product data

Details:
  TestName: createIncompleteProduct
  Description: This test checks how the createProduct method handles a Product object with missing required fields.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Product object with some missing attributes (e.g., missing name or price) and mock ProductRepository.
  Act: Call the createProduct method with the incomplete Product object.
  Assert: Expect an exception or a validation error response.
Validation:
  The assertion validates that the method enforces the integrity of the input data and rejects incomplete Product objects. This test is significant for maintaining data quality and preventing invalid data from entering the system.

Scenario 5: Product creation with invalid product data

Details:
  TestName: createInvalidProductData
  Description: This test ensures the createProduct method does not allow creation of products with invalid data (e.g., negative price).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Product object with invalid attributes (e.g., negative price) and mock ProductRepository.
  Act: Call the createProduct method with the invalid Product object.
  Assert: Expect a validation error response or an exception.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method applies business rules correctly and rejects products with invalid data. This test is important for enforcing business constraints and preventing incorrect data from being persisted.
