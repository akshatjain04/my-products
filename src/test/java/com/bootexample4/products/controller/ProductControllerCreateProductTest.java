Scenario 1: Successful creation of a new product

Details:
  TestName: createProductWithValidData
  Description: This test checks if the method successfully creates a new product when provided with valid product data.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Product object with valid attributes. Mock the ProductRepository to expect a save operation and return the provided Product.
  Act: Invoke the createProduct method with the mock Product.
  Assert: Verify that the returned Product is the same as the mock Product.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method returns the Product instance that was saved. This is important to ensure that the createProduct method is correctly persisting the Product objects and returning the saved instance.

Scenario 2: Handling of null product object

Details:
  TestName: createProductWithNullProduct
  Description: This test checks how the method handles a null Product object, expecting an exception or error handling mechanism to be triggered.
Execution:
  Arrange: Pass a null Product object to the method.
  Act: Invoke the createProduct method with null.
  Assert: Expect an exception to be thrown or an appropriate error response to be returned.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the method does not accept null objects and handles them appropriately, maintaining the integrity of the application data.

Scenario 3: Repository throws exception on save

Details:
  TestName: createProductRepositorySaveException
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the createProduct method when the ProductRepository throws an exception during the save operation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ProductRepository to throw a specific exception when the save method is called.
  Act: Invoke the createProduct method with a valid Product object.
  Assert: Expect the same exception to be propagated or handled gracefully.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the createProduct method either propagates exceptions thrown by the repository or handles them according to the application's error handling policy. This is critical for maintaining the robustness of the application.

Scenario 4: Product with invalid data

Details:
  TestName: createProductWithInvalidData
  Description: This test scenario assesses the method's response to a Product object with invalid data (e.g., missing required fields or constraints violations).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Product object with invalid attributes (e.g., null or empty fields that are required).
  Act: Invoke the createProduct method with the invalid Product.
  Assert: Verify that the method either throws a validation exception or returns an error response indicating the invalid data.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the method enforces data validation rules and does not allow the creation of products with invalid attributes, preserving data integrity and business rules.

Scenario 5: Product with existing ID

Details:
  TestName: createProductWithExistingId
  Description: This test checks the behavior when attempting to create a Product with an ID that already exists in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Product object with an ID that is already used by another Product in the database. Mock the ProductRepository to simulate a database state where the ID is not unique.
  Act: Invoke the createProduct method with the mock Product.
  Assert: Verify that the method returns an appropriate error or exception indicating the ID conflict.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the system enforces the uniqueness of product IDs and prevents the creation of duplicate products, which is essential for data consistency and integrity.
