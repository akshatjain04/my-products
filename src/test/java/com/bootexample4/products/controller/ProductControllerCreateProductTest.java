Scenario 1: Successfully create a new product

Details:
  TestName: shouldCreateProductSuccessfully
  Description: This test ensures that a valid product can be created and saved successfully using the createProduct method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Product object with valid details. Mock the productRepository.save method to return the mock Product.
  Act: Call the createProduct method with the mock Product object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned Product is the same as the mock Product.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the Product returned from the createProduct method matches the mock Product, indicating that the product was successfully created and saved. This test validates the basic functionality of the createProduct method.

Scenario 2: Attempt to create a product with null value

Details:
  TestName: shouldFailToCreateProductWhenProductIsNull
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the createProduct method when trying to save a null product, expecting an exception to be thrown.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the Product object to null.
  Act: Attempt to call the createProduct method with a null Product object.
  Assert: Expect an exception to be thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that an appropriate exception is thrown when a null Product is passed to the createProduct method. This test ensures that the method handles null inputs correctly.

Scenario 3: Handle database save errors

Details:
  TestName: shouldHandleDatabaseSaveError
  Description: This test ensures that the createProduct method properly handles situations where the productRepository fails to save a Product due to a database error.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Product object with valid details. Mock the productRepository.save method to throw a RuntimeException when called.
  Act: Try to call the createProduct method with the mock Product object.
  Assert: Expect a RuntimeException to be thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that a RuntimeException is thrown, simulating a database error during save. This test is important to verify that the createProduct method can handle exceptions thrown by the productRepository.

Scenario 4: Product creation with incomplete details

Details:
  TestName: shouldNotCreateProductWithIncompleteDetails
  Description: This test checks whether the createProduct method prevents the creation of a Product with missing mandatory fields.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Product object with missing mandatory fields. Mock the productRepository to expect a complete Product.
  Act: Attempt to call the createProduct method with the incomplete Product object.
  Assert: Verify that the method does not save the Product and returns an appropriate error or null.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the Product is not saved when mandatory fields are missing, which is crucial for maintaining data integrity. This test helps to confirm that the createProduct method validates Product details before saving.

Scenario 5: Validating response for duplicate product creation

Details:
  TestName: shouldNotAllowDuplicateProductCreation
  Description: This test verifies that the createProduct method does not allow the creation of a Product with details that already exist in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Product object with details that already exist. Mock the productRepository to return an existing Product when save is called with the same details.
  Act: Attempt to call the createProduct method with the mock Product object.
  Assert: Verify that the Product is not saved again and that an appropriate response is returned to indicate the duplication.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that a duplicate Product is not saved, which is important to prevent data duplication. This test ensures that the createProduct method includes logic to handle duplicate entries.

These scenarios provide a range of tests to validate the behavior of the createProduct method, covering successful creation, error handling, and validation of input.
