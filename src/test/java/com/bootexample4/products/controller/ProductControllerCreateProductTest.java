```
Scenario 1: Successful product creation

Details:
  TestName: shouldCreateProductSuccessfully
  Description: This test ensures that a product can be created successfully using the createProduct method and is persisted in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a Product object with valid data and a mock ProductRepository that expects the save method to be called with the Product object.
  Act: Call the createProduct method with the Product object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned Product is the same as the one passed to the method.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the product returned by the createProduct method matches the product that was saved in the mock repository. This is significant because it confirms the method's capability to handle successful product creation and persistence.

Scenario 2: Product creation with null product

Details:
  TestName: shouldThrowExceptionWhenProductIsNull
  Description: This test checks that the createProduct method throws an appropriate exception when attempting to create a product with a null value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the Product object to null and a mock ProductRepository.
  Act: Attempt to call the createProduct method with the null Product object.
  Assert: Expect an exception to be thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion validates that the method is safeguarded against null inputs, which is crucial to prevent null reference errors in the application.

Scenario 3: Product repository save failure

Details:
  TestName: shouldHandleSaveFailureGracefully
  Description: This test ensures that the createProduct method can handle scenarios where the ProductRepository fails to save the product.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product object with valid data and a mock ProductRepository that throws an exception when the save method is called.
  Act: Call the createProduct method with the Product object.
  Assert: Verify that an appropriate exception is caught or handled.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the createProduct method has proper error handling mechanisms for repository failures, which is essential for maintaining application stability and providing meaningful feedback to the user.

Scenario 4: Product creation with incomplete data

Details:
  TestName: shouldValidateProductBeforeCreation
  Description: This test verifies that the createProduct method checks for the completeness and validity of the product data before saving it.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product object with missing or invalid data (e.g., null name) and a mock ProductRepository.
  Act: Attempt to call the createProduct method with the incomplete Product object.
  Assert: Expect a validation exception or similar error to be thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that data validation is performed, which is important to avoid persisting invalid or incomplete data that could lead to data integrity issues or application errors.

Scenario 5: Product creation with existing product ID

Details:
  TestName: shouldNotCreateProductWithExistingId
  Description: This test checks that the createProduct method does not allow the creation of a product with an ID that already exists in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product object with an ID that already exists in the mock ProductRepository.
  Act: Attempt to call the createProduct method with the Product object.
  Assert: Expect an exception or error indicating that a product with the same ID cannot be created.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the method respects the uniqueness constraint of product IDs, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the dataset and avoiding duplicate records.
