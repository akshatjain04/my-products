```
Scenario 1: Creating a valid product
Details:
  TestName: createValidProduct
  Description: This test verifies that the method correctly creates a product when provided with a valid Product object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Product object with valid attributes. Mock the productRepository to expect a save operation and return the provided Product.
  Act: Call the createProduct method with the mock Product object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned Product is the same as the mock Product object.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the productRepository.save method is being called with the correct Product object and that the createProduct method returns the correct Product. This test validates the successful creation of a product in the system.
Scenario 2: Creating a product with null value
Details:
  TestName: createProductWithNullValue
  Description: This test checks how the method handles the scenario when a null Product object is passed as an argument.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the Product object to null.
  Act: Call the createProduct method with the null Product object.
  Assert: Assert that an appropriate exception is thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the application throws an exception to prevent null objects from being saved in the repository, which could cause runtime errors or data integrity issues.
Scenario 3: Handling database save failure
Details:
  TestName: handleDatabaseSaveFailure
  Description: This test ensures that the method handles cases where the productRepository fails to save the Product object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Product object with valid attributes. Mock the productRepository.save method to throw a specific DataAccessException (or a relevant exception).
  Act: Call the createProduct method with the mock Product object.
  Assert: Assert that the expected exception is thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the method correctly handles exceptions from the productRepository, ensuring the application's robustness and error handling capabilities.
Scenario 4: Creating a product with invalid attributes
Details:
  TestName: createProductWithInvalidAttributes
  Description: This test checks the behavior when a Product object with invalid attributes (e.g., blank name, negative price) is passed to the method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Product object with invalid attributes.
  Act: Call the createProduct method with the mock Product object.
  Assert: Assert that an appropriate exception or error response is returned.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the application validates Product objects before saving them to the database, enforcing business rules and data quality.
Scenario 5: Creating a product with an existing ID
Details:
  TestName: createProductWithExistingId
  Description: This test verifies the behavior when a Product object with an ID that already exists in the database is provided to the method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two mock Product objects with the same ID but different attributes. Mock the productRepository to return the first Product when save is called with the second Product.
  Act: Call the createProduct method with the second mock Product object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned Product is not the same as the first mock Product and check for any exceptions or error handling.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the application does not allow duplicate Products to be created with the same ID, maintaining data uniqueness and integrity.
Scenario 6: Creating a product successfully persists
Details:
  TestName: createProductSuccessfullyPersists
  Description: This test checks that the Product object is actually persisted in the repository when the createProduct method is called.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Product object with valid attributes. Mock the productRepository to simulate database save operation.
  Act: Call the createProduct method with the mock Product object.
  Assert: Assert that the productRepository.save method is called with the correct Product object.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the save method on the repository is invoked, confirming the interaction between the service layer and the data access layer for persisting the Product.
