Scenario 1: Validate setting price to a positive value
Details:
  TestName: setPriceToPositiveValue.
  Description: The test is designed to verify the setPrice method when a positive value is passed as argument. The functionality under test is the ability of the product to retain its price when a new price is set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of Product and initialize it with default values.
  Act: Invoke the setPrice method on the product instance, passing a positive value.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the price of the product instance matches the value passed to setPrice.
Validation:
  The test asserts that the product's price is updated correctly when a positive value is passed to setPrice. This is important as it ensures that the product's price can be updated accurately.
Scenario 2: Validate setting price to zero
Details:
  TestName: setPriceToZero.
  Description: The test is designed to verify the setPrice method when zero is passed as argument. The functionality under test is the ability of the product to retain its price when a new price is set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of Product and initialize it with default values.
  Act: Invoke the setPrice method on the product instance, passing zero.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the price of the product instance matches zero.
Validation:
  The test asserts that the product's price is updated correctly when zero is passed to setPrice. This is important as it ensures that the product's price can be updated accurately.
Scenario 3: Validate setting price to a negative value
Details:
  TestName: setPriceToNegativeValue.
  Description: The test is designed to verify the setPrice method when a negative value is passed as argument. The functionality under test is the ability of the product to retain its price when a new price is set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of Product and initialize it with default values.
  Act: Invoke the setPrice method on the product instance, passing a negative value.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the price of the product instance does not match the negative value passed to setPrice.
Validation:
  The test asserts that the product's price is not updated when a negative value is passed to setPrice. This is important as it ensures that the product's price cannot be set to a negative value.
