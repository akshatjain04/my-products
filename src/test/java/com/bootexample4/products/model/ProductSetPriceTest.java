Scenario 1: Setting a valid price

Details:
  TestName: setValidPrice
  Description: This test verifies that the price field is correctly updated when a valid price is passed to the setPrice method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the item class.
  Act: Invoke the setPrice method with a valid price value.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the price field is updated to the value passed.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the price field holds the correct value after the method call. This is important to ensure that the item's price is accurately represented in the system.

Scenario 2: Setting a negative price

Details:
  TestName: setNegativePrice
  Description: This test checks that the setPrice method handles negative price values appropriately, which might involve throwing an exception or ignoring the update.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the item class.
  Act: Invoke the setPrice method with a negative price value.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the price field is not updated or that an exception is thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion validates that the price field should not hold negative values as prices are typically non-negative in business contexts. It checks the robustness of the method against invalid input.

Scenario 3: Setting a price to zero

Details:
  TestName: setPriceToZero
  Description: This test ensures that the setPrice method can handle a zero value, which might be a valid case for certain promotional or free items.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the item class.
  Act: Invoke the setPrice method with a price value of zero.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the price field is set to zero.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the setPrice method supports setting the price to zero, which could be a legitimate scenario for free products or services.

Scenario 4: Setting a very large price

Details:
  TestName: setVeryLargePrice
  Description: This test checks how the setPrice method handles very large price values, which could cause overflow or precision issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the item class.
  Act: Invoke the setPrice method with a very large price value.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the price field is updated correctly and that no overflow or precision loss occurs.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the setPrice method can handle large values without losing accuracy, which is important for high-value items or transactions.

Scenario 5: Setting a price with high precision

Details:
  TestName: setPriceWithHighPrecision
  Description: This test checks that the setPrice method correctly handles price values with high precision, such as those with many decimal places.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the item class.
  Act: Invoke the setPrice method with a price value that has high precision.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the price field is updated with the correct precision.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the price is stored with the necessary precision, which is critical for accurate financial calculations and reporting.
