Scenario 1: Validate setting price to a positive value

Details:
  TestName: setPriceToPositiveValue.
  Description: The test is designed to verify the setPrice method when a positive value is passed as argument. The functionality under test is the ability of the product to retain its price when a new price is set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of Product and initialize it with default values.
  Act: Invoke the setPrice method on the product instance, passing a positive value.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the price of the product instance matches the value passed to setPrice.
Validation:
  The test asserts that the product's price is updated correctly when a positive value is passed to setPrice. This is important as it ensures that the product's price can be updated accurately.

Scenario 2: Validate setting price to zero

Details:
  TestName: setPriceToZero.
  Description: The test is designed to verify the setPrice method when zero is passed as argument. The functionality under test is the ability of the product to retain its price when a new price is set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of Product and initialize it with default values.
  Act: Invoke the setPrice method on the product instance, passing zero.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the price of the product instance matches zero.
Validation:
  The test asserts that the product's price is updated correctly when zero is passed to setPrice. This is important as it ensures that the product's price can be updated accurately.

Scenario 3: Validate setting price to a negative value

Details:
  TestName: setPriceToNegativeValue.
  Description: The test is designed to verify the setPrice method when a negative value is passed as argument. The functionality under test is the ability of the product to retain its price when a new price is set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of Product and initialize it with default values.
  Act: Invoke the setPrice method on the product instance, passing a negative value.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the price of the product instance does not match the negative value passed to setPrice.
Validation:
  The test asserts that the product's price is not updated when a negative value is passed to setPrice. This is important as it ensures that the product's price cannot be set to a negative value.

/*
The unit test 'setPriceToNegativeValue' is failing due to an assertion failure. This test aims to validate that the 'setPrice' method in 'Product' class should not accept negative values. However, based on the provided 'setPrice' method implementation, there is no check to prevent setting a negative value to the 'price' field. 

The 'setPrice' method merely assigns the input value to the 'price' field without any validation. Therefore, when the test is setting the 'price' field as a negative value and asserting that the 'price' should not be equal to the negative value, it fails because the 'setPrice' method does allow the 'price' to be set to a negative value.

The assertion failure message 'The price should not be set to a negative value ==> expected: not equal but was: <-100.0>' indicates this. The 'not equal' assertion is expecting that the 'price' field should not be equal to the negative value (-100.0), but it is. 

Hence, the test failure is due to the absence of business logic to handle the negative price scenario in the 'setPrice' method of the 'Product' class.
@Test
@Tag("invalid")
public void setPriceToNegativeValue() {
    // Arrange
    Product product = new Product();
    double negativePrice = -100.0;
    // Act
    product.setPrice(negativePrice);
    // Assert
    Assertions.assertNotEquals(negativePrice, product.getPrice(), "The price should not be set to a negative value");
