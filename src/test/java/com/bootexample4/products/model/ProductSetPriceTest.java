Scenario 1: Setting a valid price

Details:
  TestName: setValidPrice
  Description: This test ensures that the price field is correctly updated when a valid price is passed to the setPrice method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the item class.
  Act: Invoke the setPrice method with a valid price value.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the price field is updated to the value passed.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the price field holds the correct value after the method call. This is significant as it reflects the basic functionality of the setter to update an item's price.

Scenario 2: Setting a negative price

Details:
  TestName: setNegativePrice
  Description: This test checks how the setPrice method handles a negative price value, which could be considered invalid in a business context.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the item class.
  Act: Invoke the setPrice method with a negative price value.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the price field is not updated or an exception is thrown, depending on the business logic.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that negative prices are handled appropriately, either by not updating the price or by triggering error handling mechanisms. This is important to prevent the system from having items with invalid price values.

Scenario 3: Setting a price of zero

Details:
  TestName: setPriceToZero
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the setPrice method when the price is set to zero, which might be a special case in the system.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the item class.
  Act: Invoke the setPrice method with a price of zero.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the price field is set to zero.
Validation:
  The assertion checks whether the item can have a zero price, which could be a valid case for free items or promotions. It's significant for scenarios where items might be offered at no cost.

Scenario 4: Setting a very large price

Details:
  TestName: setVeryLargePrice
  Description: This test ensures that the setPrice method can handle very large values, which might be at the limits of the double type's range.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the item class.
  Act: Invoke the setPrice method with a very large price value.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the price field accurately reflects the large value.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the system can handle items with very high prices, which is important for applications dealing with high-value items or transactions.

Scenario 5: Setting the price when the item ID is null

Details:
  TestName: setPriceWithNullId
  Description: This test checks if the setPrice method functions correctly when the item ID is null, which might be the case before an item is persisted.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the item class without setting an ID.
  Act: Invoke the setPrice method with a valid price value.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the price is set correctly.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the setPrice method works independently of the item ID, which is important since an item's price might be set before the item is saved and assigned an ID.
