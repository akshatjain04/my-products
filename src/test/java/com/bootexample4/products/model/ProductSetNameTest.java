```
Scenario 1: Setting a valid product name

Details:
  TestName: setNameWithValidName
  Description: This test ensures that the setName method correctly assigns a valid string as the product name.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Product class.
  Act: Call the setName method with a valid string.
  Assert: Use the getName method to ensure the name has been set correctly.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the name field is set to the expected value. This is significant because the product name is a critical attribute and must be accurately stored.

Scenario 2: Setting a product name to null

Details:
  TestName: setNameWithNull
  Description: This test checks how the setName method handles null input, ensuring that the name field can be set to null if necessary.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Product class.
  Act: Call the setName method with a null value.
  Assert: Use the getName method to check if the name field is null.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the name field can be null. This is important for cases where the product name might be intentionally unset.

Scenario 3: Setting a product name to an empty string

Details:
  TestName: setNameWithEmptyString
  Description: This test ensures that the setName method can handle an empty string without causing any issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Product class.
  Act: Call the setName method with an empty string.
  Assert: Use the getName method to check if the name field is an empty string.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the name field can be an empty string. This test is crucial to ensure that the application can handle empty values for names consistently.

Scenario 4: Setting a product name with leading and trailing whitespace

Details:
  TestName: setNameWithWhitespace
  Description: This test ensures that the setName method correctly handles strings with leading and trailing whitespace.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Product class.
  Act: Call the setName method with a string containing leading and trailing whitespace.
  Assert: Use the getName method to check if the name field contains the whitespace.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the name is set exactly as provided, including the whitespace. This test is important to determine if any trimming of input strings is needed or if it is handled elsewhere in the application.

Scenario 5: Setting a product name with maximum allowed length

Details:
  TestName: setNameWithMaxLength
  Description: This test checks the setName method's behavior when provided with a string at the maximum allowed length (if defined).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Product class and define a string with the maximum allowed length.
  Act: Call the setName method with the maximum length string.
  Assert: Use the getName method to ensure the name is set correctly and has not been truncated.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the name field can handle the maximum length. This test is important to ensure that the application does not lose information due to arbitrary truncation.

Scenario 6: Setting a product name with length exceeding maximum allowed

Details:
  TestName: setNameWithLengthExceedingMax
  Description: This test determines the setName method's behavior when the input string exceeds the maximum allowed length (if defined).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Product class and define a string that exceeds the maximum allowed length.
  Act: Call the setName method with the excessively long string.
  Assert: Use the getName method to check if the name has been set, and if so, how it has been handled.
Validation:
  The assertion checks how the system handles excessively long names. This test is crucial to ensure that the application either rejects such input or handles it in a predefined manner, such as truncating to the maximum length.
```

Note: The scenarios that mention "maximum allowed length" imply that there is a defined maximum length for product names in the system. If there is no such constraint, those scenarios can be adjusted accordingly or omitted.
