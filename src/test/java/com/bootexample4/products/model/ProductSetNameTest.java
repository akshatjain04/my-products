Scenario 1: Setting a valid name
Details:
  TestName: setNameWithValidName
  Description: This test verifies that the setName method successfully sets the name of the entity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the entity class.
  Act: Call setName method on the instance with a valid string as an argument.
  Assert: Assert that the name field of the entity is equal to the valid string provided.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the setName method correctly assigns the new name to the private field. This test is significant because it ensures that the entity can have its name set as expected, which is a basic requirement for entities that have names as attributes.
Scenario 2: Setting a null name
Details:
  TestName: setNameWithNull
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the setName method when null is passed as the name.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the entity class.
  Act: Call setName method on the instance with null as an argument.
  Assert: Assert that the name field of the entity is null.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the setName method allows setting the name to null. This test is important to confirm that the entity can handle null values for the name, which may be a valid scenario in the application's logic.
Scenario 3: Setting an empty string as name
Details:
  TestName: setNameWithEmptyString
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the setName method when an empty string is passed as the name.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the entity class.
  Act: Call setName method on the instance with an empty string as an argument.
  Assert: Assert that the name field of the entity is an empty string.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the setName method can handle empty strings without throwing an error. This test is significant because it checks the robustness of the method in dealing with edge case inputs.
Scenario 4: Setting a very long name
Details:
  TestName: setNameWithVeryLongName
  Description: This test verifies that the setName method can handle very long string values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the entity class with a very long string (e.g., 1000 characters).
  Act: Call setName method on the instance with the very long string as an argument.
  Assert: Assert that the name field of the entity is equal to the very long string provided.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the setName method can handle strings that are longer than typical use cases. This test is significant for ensuring that the method does not impose arbitrary limits on the length of the name.
Scenario 5: Setting name with special characters
Details:
  TestName: setNameWithSpecialCharacters
  Description: This test verifies that the setName method can handle strings with special characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the entity class.
  Act: Call setName method on the instance with a string containing special characters as an argument.
  Assert: Assert that the name field of the entity contains the special characters.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the setName method correctly handles names with special characters. This test is significant because it checks that the entity can have names with non-alphanumeric characters, which may be required in certain contexts.
Scenario 6: Concurrent access to setName
Details:
  TestName: setNameConcurrently
  Description: This test checks the thread-safety of the setName method when accessed by multiple threads concurrently.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the entity class and multiple threads that will call setName on the instance with different names.
  Act: Start all threads and wait for their completion.
  Assert: Assert that the name field of the entity is one of the names set by the threads.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the setName method behaves correctly under concurrent access. This test is significant for ensuring thread-safety in a multi-threaded environment, which might be crucial if the entity is used in such a context.
