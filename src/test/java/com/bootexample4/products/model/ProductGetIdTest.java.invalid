ROOST_METHOD_HASH=getId_7023725436
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getId_ba349b1eff
Scenario 1: Retrieving Null Id Value
Details:  
  TestName: getIdWhenIdIsNull
  Description: This test checks if the getId method correctly returns null when the id field has not been set (i.e., its value is null).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with all fields set to null.
  Act: Call the getId method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the result is null.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the getId method returns null for an uninitialized id field, which is expected since the id has not been set. This test is significant to ensure that the method handles null values correctly without throwing an exception.
Scenario 2: Retrieving a Valid Id Value
Details:  
  TestName: getIdWithValidId
  Description: This test is designed to verify that the getId method returns the correct id value when the id field is properly initialized.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set the id field to a known Long value.
  Act: Call the getId method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the result matches the known Long value that was set.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks whether the getId method correctly retrieves the id value that was set. This test is essential to confirm that the method accurately reflects the state of the id field in the class.
Scenario 3: Id Generation Strategy
Details:  
  TestName: getIdAfterEntityPersistence
  Description: This test verifies that the getId method returns a generated id after the entity has been persisted, which should trigger the @GeneratedValue strategy.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the persistence context and create an instance of the class. Simulate the entity persistence behavior to trigger the id generation.
  Act: Call the getId method on the instance after persistence.
  Assert: Assert that the result is a non-null Long value.
Validation: 
  The assertion confirms that the id field is populated with a generated value after the entity is persisted, as per the @GeneratedValue annotation. This test is crucial to ensure that the id generation strategy is working as expected within a persistence context.
Scenario 4: Id Uniqueness After Persistence
Details:  
  TestName: getIdUniquenessAfterPersistence
  Description: This test checks that the getId method returns unique ids for different instances after they have been persisted.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the persistence context and create two different instances of the class. Simulate the entity persistence behavior to trigger id generation for both instances.
  Act: Call the getId method on both instances after persistence.
  Assert: Assert that the ids are not equal.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that each persisted entity receives a unique id, as expected by the @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO) annotation. This test is important to validate the integrity of the entity identification within the persistence layer.
Scenario 5: Id Unchanged After Retrieval
Details:  
  TestName: getIdUnchangedAfterMultipleRetrievals
  Description: This test ensures that the getId method returns the same id value across multiple invocations, indicating that the id field is immutable once set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with a known Long id value.
  Act: Call the getId method on the instance multiple times.
  Assert: Assert that the returned id remains consistent across the invocations.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks the immutability of the id field by confirming that the getId method returns the same value consistently. This test is significant to ensure that the id field is not inadvertently modified, which could compromise entity tracking and integrity.
