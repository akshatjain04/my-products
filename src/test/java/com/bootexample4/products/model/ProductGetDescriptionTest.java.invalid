Scenario 1: Retrieving a null description
Details:  
  TestName: getDescriptionWhenDescriptionIsNull
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the getDescription method when the description field is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the entity class with the description field set to null.
  Act: Call the getDescription method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is null.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the getDescription method correctly handles the scenario where the description is null, which is a possible state given the field's declaration. This test is significant as it validates the method's ability to handle null values gracefully, without throwing exceptions.
Scenario 2: Retrieving a non-empty description
Details:  
  TestName: getDescriptionWhenDescriptionIsNotEmpty
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the getDescription method when the description field has a non-empty value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the entity class with the description field set to a non-empty string (e.g., "Sample description").
  Act: Call the getDescription method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value equals the non-empty string set in the Arrange step.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the getDescription method correctly returns the value of the description field when it is not null. This test is important to confirm that the method accurately provides the content of the description, reflecting the current state of the object.
Scenario 3: Retrieving an empty description
Details:  
  TestName: getDescriptionWhenDescriptionIsEmpty
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the getDescription method when the description field is an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the entity class with the description field set to an empty string.
  Act: Call the getDescription method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is an empty string.
Validation: 
  The assertion ensures that the getDescription method can handle an empty string, which is a valid state for a String field. This test is crucial to verify that the method does not alter the description content in any way and returns it as is.
Scenario 4: Retrieving description after setting a new value
Details:  
  TestName: getDescriptionAfterSettingNewValue
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the getDescription method after the description field has been updated with a new value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the entity class and set the description field to a new string value (e.g., "Updated description").
  Act: Call the getDescription method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the newly set description.
Validation: 
  The assertion confirms that the getDescription method returns the most recent value of the description. This test is essential to ensure that any updates to the description field are reflected when the method is invoked, which is important for maintaining data integrity and consistency within the entity.
Note: Since there are no setter methods or constructors provided, we assume that they exist in the class for the purpose of the Arrange step in the scenarios above. If not, the Arrange step would involve using reflection or other means to set the private fields, which is not a common practice for unit testing and would usually be avoided.
