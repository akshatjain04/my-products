Scenario 1: Retrieving Null Id Value
Details:
  TestName: getIdWhenIdIsNull
  Description: This test checks if the getId method correctly returns null when the id field has not been set (i.e., its value is null).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with all fields set to null.
  Act: Call the getId method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the result is null.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getId method returns null for a new object with no id assigned. This is significant as it reflects the initial state of an entity before it has been persisted to the database.
Scenario 2: Retrieving Non-Null Id Value
Details:
  TestName: getIdWhenIdIsNotNull
  Description: This test checks if the getId method correctly returns the proper id value when it has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set the id field with a non-null value.
  Act: Call the getId method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the result matches the value set for the id field.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getId method correctly retrieves the value of the id field. This is significant as it confirms the entity's identity can be accurately obtained, which is critical for database operations.
Scenario 3: Id Unchanged After Entity Creation
Details:
  TestName: getIdAfterEntityCreation
  Description: This test verifies that the getId method returns the same id value after an entity has been created and potentially processed by the persistence layer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate the creation of an entity and assume it is assigned an id by the persistence layer.
  Act: Call the getId method on the entity.
  Assert: Assert that the id returned is the same as the one assigned during the simulation.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the getId method retrieves the correct id value post-entity creation, ensuring that the identity of the entity is maintained. This is important for the integrity of database operations post-persistence.
Scenario 4: Id Consistency Across Multiple Calls
Details:
  TestName: getIdConsistencyCheck
  Description: This test ensures that multiple calls to the getId method return the same value, assuming no changes are made to the id field in between calls.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set a specific id value.
  Act: Call the getId method multiple times on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that all calls return the same id value.
Validation:
  The assertion checks for the consistency of the id value across multiple invocations of getId, which is important to ensure the reliability of the entity's identity.
Scenario 5: Id Unaffected by Other Field Changes
Details:
  TestName: getIdWhenOtherFieldsChange
  Description: This test checks that changes to fields other than the id do not affect the result of the getId method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with a specific id and change other fields such as name, description, and price.
  Act: Call the getId method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the id returned is the same as the initial id value, and unaffected by changes to other fields.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the getId method's return value is isolated from changes in other fields, emphasizing the stability of the entity's identity regardless of other attribute modifications.
Scenario 6: Id Value After Entity Is Persisted
Details:
  TestName: getIdAfterEntityPersistence
  Description: This test verifies that the getId method returns the generated id value after an entity is persisted and an id is auto-generated.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate the persistence of an entity and the auto-generation of an id using the @GeneratedValue annotation.
  Act: Call the getId method on the persisted entity.
  Assert: Assert that the id returned is the one that was auto-generated during persistence.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the getId method retrieves the correct, auto-generated id value after an entity is persisted, which is crucial for the entity's subsequent identification and database operations.
