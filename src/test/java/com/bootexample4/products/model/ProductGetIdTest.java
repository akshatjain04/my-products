Scenario 1: Test to Get ID when ID is null

Details:
  TestName: testGetIdWhenIdIsNull
  Description: This test scenario checks if the getId() method correctly returns null when the id has not been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a new Product object.
  Act: Call the getId() method on the Product object.
  Assert: Assert that the return value is null.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getId() function correctly returns null. This confirms that the default value for id is null, as expected, which is significant as this is the intended behavior when the id is not set in a new Product.

Scenario 2: Test to Get ID after setting it

Details:
  TestName: testGetIdAfterSettingId
  Description: This test scenario checks if the getId() method correctly returns the value of id after it has been set using the setId() method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a new Product object and set the id by calling setId() method.
  Act: Call the getId() method on the Product object.
  Assert: Assert that the return value is the same as the one set.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getId() function correctly returns the value set by the setId() method. This confirms that the id setter and getter are working as expected, which is crucial for creating and retrieving Product objects.

Scenario 3: Test to Get ID after setting it to a large value

Details:
  TestName: testGetIdAfterSettingLargeId
  Description: This test scenario checks if the getId() method correctly returns the value of id after it has been set using setId() method to a very large value, close to the limit of the Long type.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a new Product object and set id to a large Long value.
  Act: Call the getId() method on the Product object.
  Assert: Assert that the return value is the same as the large value set for id.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getId() function can handle large values for id. This confirms that the class appropriately handles Long data type, and its methods can manage large id values, which are valid for this type.

Scenario 4: Test to Get ID after setting it to zero

Details:
  TestName: testGetIdAfterSettingIdToZero
  Description: This test scenario checks if the getId() method correctly returns the value of id after it has been set to zero using the setId() method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a new Product object and set id to zero.
  Act: Call the getId() method on the Product object.
  Assert: Assert that the return value is zero.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getId() function correctly returns zero when the id is set to this value. This scenario is critical as zero should be a valid id value for a product.
