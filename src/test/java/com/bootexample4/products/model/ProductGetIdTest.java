Scenario 1: Retrieving Null Id Value

Details:
  TestName: getIdWhenIdIsNull
  Description: This test checks if the getId method returns null when the id field has not been set (i.e., it is null).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the entity class without setting the id field.
  Act: Invoke the getId method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is null.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the default state of the id field is null if it has not been manually set or auto-generated. This is significant as it represents the state of a newly created entity that has not been persisted yet.

Scenario 2: Retrieving a Non-Null Id Value

Details:
  TestName: getIdWhenIdIsSet
  Description: This test ensures that the getId method returns the correct id value after the id has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the entity class and set the id field with a known Long value.
  Act: Invoke the getId method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the known Long value that was set.
Validation:
  The assertion checks whether the getId method correctly retrieves the value of the id field. This is crucial because it verifies the entity's ability to provide its own identifier, which is fundamental for database operations.

Scenario 3: Id Auto-Generation Behavior

Details:
  TestName: getIdAfterAutoGeneration
  Description: This test is designed to verify that the getId method returns a non-null value after the entity has been saved and the id has been auto-generated.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate the persistence of the entity class instance to trigger id auto-generation.
  Act: Invoke the getId method on the persisted instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is not null.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the id field is auto-generated upon persistence, as indicated by the @GeneratedValue annotation. This test is important to ensure that the entity can be uniquely identified in the database after being saved.

Scenario 4: Id Uniqueness After Persistence

Details:
  TestName: getIdUniquenessAfterPersistence
  Description: This scenario tests that each entity instance gets a unique id after being persisted.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate the persistence of two different instances of the entity class.
  Act: Invoke the getId method on both instances.
  Assert: Assert that the two returned id values are not equal.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the @GeneratedValue strategy is correctly providing unique identifiers for each persisted entity. The uniqueness of ids is essential for distinguishing between different records in the database.

Scenario 5: Id Consistency Before And After Persistence

Details:
  TestName: getIdConsistencyBeforeAndAfterPersistence
  Description: This test ensures that the id value remains consistent before and after the entity is persisted.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the entity class and set a specific id value. Simulate the persistence process without changing the id.
  Act: Invoke the getId method before and after the simulated persistence.
  Assert: Assert that both returned id values are the same.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the entity's id does not change through the lifecycle of persistence, which is critical for maintaining a consistent reference to the same database record.

These scenarios cover the basic functionality of the getId method, taking into account the behavior of the id field as a private, auto-generated Long type within a JPA entity context.
