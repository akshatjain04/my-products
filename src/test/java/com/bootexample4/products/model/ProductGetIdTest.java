Scenario 1: Retrieving a null ID when the entity has not been persisted

Details:
  TestName: getIdWhenNotPersisted
  Description: This test checks if the getId method returns null when the entity has not been persisted and the ID has not been generated or set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the entity with all properties set to their default values, ensuring the id field is null.
  Act: Call the getId method on the entity instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is null.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getId method correctly reflects the entity's state, which is unpersisted with a null ID. This is significant as it confirms the behavior of the method before an entity is managed by the persistence context.

Scenario 2: Retrieving the correct ID after the entity has been persisted

Details:
  TestName: getIdAfterPersistence
  Description: This test ensures that the getId method returns the correct ID after the entity has been persisted and the ID has been generated.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate the persistence of the entity and the generation of the ID (this could be mocked if using a real database is not feasible).
  Act: Call the getId method on the persisted entity instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the generated ID.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the getId method accurately retrieves the ID assigned by the persistence mechanism. This test is crucial for verifying that the entity can be correctly identified after being stored in the database, which is fundamental for CRUD operations.

Scenario 3: Ensuring getId is unaffected by changes to other fields

Details:
  TestName: getIdUnaffectedByOtherFields
  Description: This test verifies that changes to fields other than 'id' have no impact on the result of the getId method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an entity with a set ID, and modify other fields such as name, description, and price.
  Act: Invoke the getId method on the modified entity.
  Assert: Confirm that the ID remains consistent and unchanged.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the getId method is isolated from other entity properties and maintains data integrity. This test is important to guarantee that the identity of the entity is stable and not susceptible to side effects from changes to non-identity-related fields.

Scenario 4: Verifying getId behavior with a manually set ID

Details:
  TestName: getIdWithManualIdSet
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the getId method when the ID is manually set on the entity, without relying on the persistence context for ID generation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an entity and manually set the ID field to a specific Long value.
  Act: Call the getId method on the entity.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ID matches the manually set value.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the getId method accurately returns the manually set ID. This is important for scenarios where the ID might be set programmatically instead of being generated by the persistence provider, ensuring the method's flexibility and correctness.

These scenarios aim to cover the typical use cases and edge cases for the getId method, considering its simplicity and the context provided by the class fields and annotations.
