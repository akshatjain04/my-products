Scenario 1: Retrieving Null Id Value

Details:
  TestName: getIdWhenIdIsNull
  Description: This test checks if the getId method correctly returns null when the id field has not been set (i.e., its value is null).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the getId method without setting the id field.
  Act: Invoke the getId method on the created instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is null.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getId method should return null when the id field is uninitialized. This is significant because it reflects the initial state of a newly created object that has not been persisted or assigned an identifier.

Scenario 2: Retrieving a Valid Id Value

Details:
  TestName: getIdWithValidId
  Description: This test ensures that the getId method returns the correct Long value that has been set as the id of the object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set a valid Long value to the id field using a public setter method or constructor, if available.
  Act: Invoke the getId method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the Long value set for the id field.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the getId method returns the exact value of the id field. Validating this behavior is crucial as it ensures the object can be correctly identified and referenced, which is important for database operations given the @Id and @GeneratedValue annotations.

Scenario 3: Id Persistence Annotation

Details:
  TestName: getIdAnnotatedWithId
  Description: This test verifies if the id field is properly annotated with @Id, indicating it's the primary key of the entity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use reflection to access the id field of the class.
  Act: Check for the presence of @Id annotation on the id field.
  Assert: Assert that the @Id annotation is present.
Validation:
  This test validates whether the id field is correctly annotated for JPA to recognize it as the primary key. This is critical for the framework to handle it appropriately during database operations.

Scenario 4: Id Generation Strategy Annotation

Details:
  TestName: idFieldAnnotatedWithGeneratedValue
  Description: This test checks if the id field has the @GeneratedValue annotation with the correct strategy for automatic id generation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use reflection to access the id field of the class.
  Act: Check for the presence of @GeneratedValue annotation on the id field and inspect the strategy attribute.
  Assert: Assert that the @GeneratedValue annotation is present and the strategy is set to the expected value (e.g., GenerationType.AUTO).
Validation:
  This assertion ensures that the id field is set up for automatic generation with the correct strategy, which is essential for the persistence layer to auto-generate identifiers when new entity instances are created and saved.

Scenario 5: Id Field Access Modifier

Details:
  TestName: idFieldIsPrivate
  Description: This test checks that the id field is declared with a private access modifier, following encapsulation principles.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use reflection to access the id field of the class.
  Act: Retrieve the access modifiers of the id field.
  Assert: Assert that the access modifier of the id field is private.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the id field is private, enforcing encapsulation. This is important for maintaining the integrity of the object's state and ensuring that the id can only be accessed and modified through controlled means, such as getter and setter methods.
