Scenario 1: Retrieving Null Id Value

Details:
  TestName: getIdWhenIdIsNull
  Description: This test checks if the getId method correctly returns null when the id field has not been set (i.e., its value is null).

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class without setting the id field.
  Act: Call the getId method on the created instance.
  Assert: Assert that the result is null.

Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getId method returns null for an uninitialized id field, which is expected since the id has not been set. This test is significant to ensure that the method handles uninitialized states correctly.

Scenario 2: Retrieving a Non-null Id Value

Details:
  TestName: getIdWhenIdIsSet
  Description: This test checks if the getId method correctly returns the value of the id field when it is set.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set the id field to a specific Long value.
  Act: Call the getId method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the result equals the set Long value.

Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getId method returns the correct id value that was set on the class instance, confirming that the getter is functioning as intended. This test is critical to ensure that the class can reliably provide its identifier when needed.

Scenario 3: Id Value After Entity Persistence

Details:
  TestName: getIdAfterEntityPersistence
  Description: This test verifies if the getId method returns a generated id value after the entity has been persisted, considering the @GeneratedValue annotation.

Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the persistence context and create an instance of the class. Simulate the entity persistence operation that would generate the id.
  Act: Call the getId method on the instance after the simulated persistence operation.
  Assert: Assert that the result is not null and is of type Long.

Validation:
  The assertion checks that the getId method returns a valid Long value after the entity is persisted, which is expected because the @GeneratedValue annotation should have been triggered. This test is important to ensure that the entity can provide its generated identifier post-persistence.

Scenario 4: Consistency of Id Value Across Multiple Calls

Details:
  TestName: getIdConsistencyAcrossCalls
  Description: This test checks if the getId method returns the same id value across multiple invocations.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set the id field to a specific Long value.
  Act: Call the getId method on the instance multiple times.
  Assert: Assert that all returned id values are the same.

Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the getId method is consistent and does not produce different values across multiple calls. This test is crucial to confirm the immutability and reliability of the id once it is set.

Scenario 5: Id Unaffected by Other Field Changes

Details:
  TestName: getIdUnchangedByOtherFieldModifications
  Description: This test ensures that the getId method returns the same id value even after other fields of the class instance have been modified.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with a specific id. Modify other fields like name, description, or price.
  Act: Call the getId method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the result matches the original id value.

Validation:
  The assertion checks that modifications to other fields do not affect the id value returned by getId. This test is significant to ensure field encapsulation and that the id remains a stable identifier for the entity.
