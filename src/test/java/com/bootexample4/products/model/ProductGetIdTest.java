Scenario 1: Retrieving Null Id Value

Details:
  TestName: getIdShouldReturnNullWhenIdIsNull
  Description: This test checks that the getId method returns null when the id field has not been set (i.e., it is null).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the entity class without setting the id field.
  Act: Call the getId method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the result of getId is null.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getId method correctly handles cases where the id field is null by returning a null value. This is significant since prior to persistence, a new entity instance may not have an id assigned yet, and the method should reflect this state accurately.

Scenario 2: Retrieving a Non-Null Id Value

Details:
  TestName: getIdShouldReturnCorrectValueWhenIdIsSet
  Description: This test ensures that the getId method returns the correct id value when the id field is set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the entity class and set the id field using a setter or reflection if no setter is available.
  Act: Call the getId method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the result of getId matches the value set for the id field.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the getId method accurately retrieves the value of the id field when it has been set. This test is important to ensure that the entity can be correctly identified by its id after it has been persisted and its id has been generated.

Scenario 3: Id Field Persistence Annotation

Details:
  TestName: idFieldShouldHavePersistenceAnnotations
  Description: This test verifies that the id field is appropriately annotated with persistence annotations such as @Id and @GeneratedValue.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use reflection to obtain the annotations on the id field.
  Act: Check for the presence of @Id and @GeneratedValue annotations.
  Assert: Assert that the annotations are present and correctly configured.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the entity's id field is correctly set up for persistence in a JPA context, ensuring that it will be treated as a primary key and that its value will be automatically generated. This test is important for the correct behavior of the entity within a database environment.

These scenarios cover the basic functionality and validation of the getId method and the configuration of the id field within the context of a JPA entity. Additional tests may be necessary to cover the full range of behaviors, but these will depend on other methods and behaviors of the entity class.

	@Test
	@Category(Categories.boundary.class)/*
The unit test `idFieldShouldHavePersistenceAnnotations` is failing because the assertion that checks if the 'id' field has the `@GeneratedValue` annotation with the strategy set to `AUTO` is not met. The error log indicates that the `assertTrue` for the `@GeneratedValue` annotation with `AUTO` strategy is failing, which means that either the 'id' field does not have the `@GeneratedValue` annotation at all, or it has the annotation but with a different generation strategy than `AUTO`.

To resolve this issue, we should check the `Product` class to ensure that the 'id' field is annotated with `@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)`. If the annotation is missing or the strategy is set to a different value, it should be corrected to match the expected `AUTO` strategy. Once this correction is made, the test should pass assuming there are no other unrelated issues.

Given that the error is specific to the assertion and not a compilation or build failure, and no issues with external dependencies have been indicated, this seems to be a straightforward case of the business logic (the `Product` class in this case) not meeting the expectations set forth in the test case.
