Scenario 1: Retrieving ID of a newly created product

Details:
  TestName: retrieveIdOfNewProduct
  Description: This test ensures that the getId method returns null for a new Product instance which has not been assigned an ID yet.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of Product.
  Act: Invoke the getId method on the new Product instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ID is null.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the ID of a new Product is null as it has not been assigned. This is crucial for identifying unsaved or transient entities within the application.

Scenario 2: Retrieving ID of an existing product

Details:
  TestName: retrieveIdOfExistingProduct
  Description: This test checks if the getId method correctly retrieves the ID of a Product instance that has been assigned an ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Product instance and set its ID using setId method.
  Act: Invoke the getId method on the Product instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ID matches the ID that was set.
Validation:
  The assertion validates that getId correctly returns the ID that has been set, ensuring the integrity of entity identification within the persistence context.

Scenario 3: Consistency of ID retrieval over multiple calls

Details:
  TestName: consistentIdRetrievalOverMultipleCalls
  Description: This test ensures that repeated invocations of getId return the same ID for a Product instance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Product instance and set a specific ID using setId.
  Act: Invoke the getId method on the instance multiple times.
  Assert: Assert that all invocations return the same ID.
Validation:
  The assertion checks for consistency in the getId method, which is important to confirm that the entity's identity does not change across its lifecycle.

Scenario 4: Effect of setting a null ID on retrieval

Details:
  TestName: effectOfNullIdOnRetrieval
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of getId after setting the Product's ID to null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Product instance, set a non-null ID, then set the ID to null.
  Act: Invoke the getId method on the Product instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ID is null.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that setting an ID to null is reflected when getId is called, which may represent a case of detaching the entity from the persistence context.

Scenario 5: Retrieving ID after setting a negative value

Details:
  TestName: retrieveIdAfterSettingNegativeValue
  Description: This test checks the behavior of getId after setting the ID to a negative value, which is typically an invalid ID value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Product instance and set its ID to a negative value using setId.
  Act: Invoke the getId method on the Product instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ID is the negative value that was set.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that getId accurately reflects the set ID, even if it's negative, which helps in testing the robustness of the entity's ID handling.
```

Note: While these scenarios provide a comprehensive test suite for the `getId` method, in practice, some might be considered redundant or unnecessary depending on the business logic and the persistence framework's guarantees. For instance, testing for consistency over multiple calls (Scenario 3) might be omitted if the framework ensures immutable IDs after assignment.
