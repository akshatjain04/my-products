Scenario 1: Retrieving Null Id Value

Details:
  TestName: getIdWhenIdIsNull
  Description: This test checks if the getId method returns null when the id field has not been set (i.e., it is null).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the entity class without setting the id field.
  Act: Invoke the getId method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is null.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getId method correctly returns a null value when the id has not been initialized. This is significant because it reflects the initial state of a new entity before it has been persisted and assigned an identifier.

Scenario 2: Retrieving Non-Null Id Value

Details:
  TestName: getIdWhenIdIsNotNull
  Description: This test ensures that the getId method returns the correct non-null id value after the entity has been persisted and an id has been generated.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the entity class and simulate the id being set, typically by a persistence mechanism, to a non-null Long value.
  Act: Invoke the getId method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is the same as the id set during the arrangement.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the getId method returns the actual id value of the entity. This is crucial as it confirms the integrity of the entity's identifier after persistence operations.

Scenario 3: Consistency of Id Value Across Multiple Calls

Details:
  TestName: getIdConsistencyAcrossMultipleCalls
  Description: This test verifies that multiple invocations of the getId method return the same value, ensuring that the id property is stable and not modified between calls.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the entity class with a set id value.
  Act: Invoke the getId method on the instance multiple times.
  Assert: Assert that all returned values are identical.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the getId method is idempotent and that the id value remains constant across multiple calls. This consistency is vital for the reliability of the entity's identity within the application.

Scenario 4: Id Generation Strategy Compliance

Details:
  TestName: getIdCompliesWithGenerationStrategy
  Description: This test checks if the id generated for the entity complies with the specified generation strategy (e.g., AUTO, IDENTITY, SEQUENCE, TABLE).
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate the persistence process and id generation according to the generation strategy defined by the @GeneratedValue annotation.
  Act: Invoke the getId method on a persisted entity.
  Assert: Assert that the id conforms to the expected generation strategy pattern or sequence.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the id generation adheres to the specified strategy, which is crucial for ensuring the uniqueness and consistency of entity identifiers within the database context.

Scenario 5: Id Uniqueness Across Entities

Details:
  TestName: getIdUniquenessAcrossEntities
  Description: This test ensures that the ids generated for different entities are unique, preventing any conflicts or collisions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate the persistence process for multiple entities, ensuring each has a generated id.
  Act: Invoke the getId method on each persisted entity.
  Assert: Assert that each id is unique across all entities.
Validation:
  The assertion checks for the uniqueness of the id field for each entity, which is essential to maintain the integrity of the database and the application's data model.

These scenarios outline a comprehensive testing strategy for the getId method, ensuring that it behaves correctly in various situations and adheres to the expectations of the persistence framework and the application's business logic.
