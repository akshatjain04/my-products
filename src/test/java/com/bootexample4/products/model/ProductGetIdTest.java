```
Scenario 1: Retrieving ID when it is set to a specific value

Details:
  TestName: getIdWhenIdIsSet
  Description: This test verifies that the getId method correctly returns the value of the product's ID after it has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Product class and set the ID to a specific value using setId.
  Act: Invoke the getId method on the Product instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ID matches the value that was set initially.
Validation:
  Clarify that the getId method should return the exact ID value that was previously assigned to the product. This is important to ensure data integrity and consistency within the application.

Scenario 2: Retrieving ID when no ID has been set

Details:
  TestName: getIdWhenIdIsNotSet
  Description: This test checks if the getId method returns null when the ID has not been explicitly set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Product class without setting the ID.
  Act: Invoke the getId method on the Product instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ID is null.
Validation:
  Clarify that the getId method should return null when the ID has not been initialized. This behavior is expected as the default state of an object's numeric field that has not been set should be null.

Scenario 3: Retrieving ID after resetting it to a new value

Details:
  TestName: getIdAfterResettingId
  Description: This test ensures that the getId method reflects changes when the product's ID is updated to a new value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product instance and set an initial ID, then reset it to a different value using setId.
  Act: Invoke the getId method on the Product instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ID matches the new value that was set.
Validation:
  Clarify that the getId method should return the updated ID value after it has been reset. It confirms that the setter method works correctly and that the state of the Product instance is mutable as expected.

Scenario 4: Retrieving ID for multiple Product instances

Details:
  TestName: getIdForMultipleInstances
  Description: This test checks that the getId method returns correct IDs for multiple instances of the Product class with different IDs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create several instances of the Product class, each with a unique ID.
  Act: Invoke the getId method on each Product instance.
  Assert: Assert that each returned ID matches the value set for each specific instance.
Validation:
  Clarify that each Product instance maintains its own state and that the getId method should return the correct ID specific to each instance. This test ensures that there is no unintended sharing of state between instances, which is crucial for the correct functioning of the application.

Scenario 5: Retrieving ID after setting it to the maximum value for Long

Details:
  TestName: getIdWhenIdIsMaxLongValue
  Description: This test ensures that the getId method can handle and correctly return the maximum value for a Long type when the ID is set to Long.MAX_VALUE.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product instance and set its ID to Long.MAX_VALUE using setId.
  Act: Invoke the getId method on the Product instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ID is equal to Long.MAX_VALUE.
Validation:
  Clarify that the getId method should be able to handle the full range of Long values, including the maximum possible value. This test checks the robustness of the method in handling edge cases with respect to numeric limits.
