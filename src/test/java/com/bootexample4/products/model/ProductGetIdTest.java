Scenario 1: Retrieving a null ID value when the entity is new and not persisted
Details:
  TestName: getIdWhenNotPersisted
  Description: This test checks that getId() returns null when the entity has not been saved to the database (i.e., it is new and not persisted).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the entity class with no fields set.
  Act: Call the getId() method on the created instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is null.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getId method should return null for a new entity that has not been assigned an ID. This is because the ID is generated upon persistence, and before that, it should be null. The test is significant as it ensures the entity's lifecycle starts with a null ID, indicating it hasn't been persisted yet.
Scenario 2: Retrieving an ID value after the entity is persisted
Details:
  TestName: getIdAfterPersistence
  Description: This test checks that getId() returns the correct non-null ID after the entity has been persisted.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate the persistence of the entity and set the ID field with a mock generated value.
  Act: Call the getId() method on the persisted entity.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ID matches the mock value set during the arrange phase.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getId method should return the correct ID that was generated during the persistence process. This test is significant as it ensures that once an entity is persisted, its ID field is correctly populated and retrievable.
Scenario 3: Ensuring thread safety of the getId method
Details:
  TestName: getIdThreadSafety
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getId method can be accessed by multiple threads safely without causing any race conditions or incorrect data retrieval.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the entity and set its ID. Start multiple threads to access the getId method simultaneously.
  Act: Each thread calls the getId method.
  Assert: Assert that all threads retrieve the same ID value that was set during the arrange phase.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that getId is thread-safe and returns consistent results even when accessed by multiple threads. This is significant for the application's concurrency integrity, ensuring that the ID value remains consistent across different threads.
Scenario 4: Retrieving ID after altering other fields of the entity
Details:
  TestName: getIdAfterAlteringFields
  Description: This test checks that getId() returns the correct ID even after other fields of the entity have been modified.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the entity, set the ID, and modify other fields like name, description, and price.
  Act: Call the getId() method on the modified entity.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ID is unaffected by changes to other fields.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getId method should consistently return the same ID regardless of modifications to other fields of the entity. This test is significant as it ensures that the ID field is immutable and remains stable as a unique identifier for the entity.
