Scenario 1: Valid Id Retrieval
Details:
  TestName: getIdShouldReturnValidId
  Description: This test ensures that the getId method returns a valid Long type ID when the entity has been properly initialized and an ID has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create and persist an entity with a known ID.
  Act: Invoke the getId method on the entity.
  Assert: Verify that the returned ID matches the known ID that was set during the Arrange step.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getId method returns the correct ID that has been generated and assigned to the entity. This is crucial for identifying the entity uniquely in the database and confirms that the JPA annotations are functioning as expected.
Scenario 2: Null Id Before Persistence
Details:
  TestName: getIdShouldReturnNullIfNotPersisted
  Description: This test checks if the getId method returns null for an entity that has not been persisted yet and therefore does not have an ID assigned.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new entity without persisting it.
  Act: Invoke the getId method on the new entity.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ID is null.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms the expected behavior that an entity's ID should be null if it hasn't been assigned yet. This test is significant as it ensures that the entity lifecycle is respected and that IDs are only assigned upon persistence.
Scenario 3: Auto-generated Id After Persistence
Details:
  TestName: getIdShouldReturnAutoGeneratedIdAfterPersistence
  Description: This test ensures that the getId method returns an auto-generated ID after the entity has been persisted, reflecting the @GeneratedValue strategy.
Execution:
  Arrange: Persist a new entity without setting an ID manually.
  Act: Invoke the getId method on the newly persisted entity.
  Assert: Verify that the returned ID is not null and is auto-generated.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the ID is generated according to the strategy defined by @GeneratedValue and that it is not null after persistence. This test is important to ensure that the entity's ID is being generated automatically as expected by the application.
Scenario 4: Id Unchanged After Persistence
Details:
  TestName: getIdShouldReturnSameIdAfterMultipleCalls
  Description: This test verifies that multiple calls to getId return the same ID, ensuring the ID's immutability after persistence.
Execution:
  Arrange: Persist a new entity and retrieve the ID.
  Act: Invoke the getId method multiple times on the same entity.
  Assert: Check that all invocations return the same ID.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the ID of an entity remains constant across multiple calls, which is essential for entity identification and integrity. It also validates the immutability aspect of the entity's ID after it has been set.
Scenario 5: Consistent Id Across Transactions
Details:
  TestName: getIdShouldReturnConsistentIdAcrossTransactions
  Description: This test checks that the ID remains consistent across different transactions, ensuring that the ID does not change once assigned.
Execution:
  Arrange: Persist an entity and commit the transaction to retrieve the ID. Then start a new transaction.
  Act: Retrieve the same entity in the new transaction and invoke the getId method.
  Assert: Confirm that the ID is the same across both transactions.
Validation:
  The assertion validates that the ID is a stable identifier for the entity across different database transactions. This consistency is crucial for data integrity and reliable references to the entity within the application.
