Scenario 1: Retrieving a null ID value when the entity is not persisted

Details:
  TestName: getIdWhenNotPersisted
  Description: This test checks if the getId method returns null when the entity has not been persisted and the ID has not been generated.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the entity class without setting the ID.
  Act: Invoke the getId method on the entity instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ID is null.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the ID is null since the entity has not been persisted and no ID has been generated. This is significant because it confirms the initial state of a new entity before persistence.

Scenario 2: Retrieving a non-null ID value after the entity is persisted

Details:
  TestName: getIdAfterPersistence
  Description: This test ensures that the getId method returns a non-null ID after the entity has been persisted and an ID has been generated.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate the persistence of the entity and the generation of an ID value (e.g., using a mock if necessary).
  Act: Invoke the getId method on the entity instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ID is not null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the ID is correctly assigned and retrievable after the entity is persisted. This test is important to ensure that the JPA @Id and @GeneratedValue annotations are functioning as expected and that the entity can be uniquely identified after persistence.

Scenario 3: Retrieving the correct ID value set on the entity

Details:
  TestName: getIdWithPredefinedValue
  Description: This test checks if the getId method returns the correct ID that was explicitly set on the entity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the entity class and set a known ID value.
  Act: Invoke the getId method on the entity instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ID matches the known ID value that was set.
Validation:
  This assertion checks the consistency and integrity of the ID value. It is important to ensure that the ID getter method is accurately reflecting the state of the entity and that the ID can be reliably used to reference the entity.

Scenario 4: Ensuring thread safety of the getId method

Details:
  TestName: getIdThreadSafetyCheck
  Description: This test verifies that the getId method can be safely called by multiple threads without causing data corruption or inconsistencies.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the entity class with a set ID. Simulate multiple threads calling the getId method concurrently.
  Act: Invoke the getId method from multiple threads.
  Assert: Assert that all threads receive the same ID value and that no exceptions or errors occur.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the getId method is thread-safe and that concurrent access does not lead to incorrect behavior. This is critical for applications that may access entities concurrently in a multi-threaded environment.

Scenario 5: Compatibility with JPA entity lifecycle

Details:
  TestName: getIdCompatibilityWithJpaLifecycle
  Description: This test ensures that the getId method's behavior is compatible with the JPA entity lifecycle, particularly after the entity transitions through different states (e.g., transient, managed, detached).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the entity class, simulate different JPA lifecycle states, and observe the getId behavior in each state.
  Act: Invoke the getId method during different lifecycle phases.
  Assert: Assert that the ID is consistent with expectations during each lifecycle phase.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getId method behaves as expected throughout the JPA entity lifecycle. This test is significant for confirming that the entity's identity is maintained correctly as it passes through various persistence contexts and operations.
