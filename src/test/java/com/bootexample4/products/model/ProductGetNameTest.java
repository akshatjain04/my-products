Scenario 1: Retrieving the default null name
Details:
  TestName: getNameReturnsNullWhenNotSet
  Description: This test checks that the getName method returns null when the name has not been initialized or set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class without setting the name field.
  Act: Invoke the getName method on the created instance.
  Assert: Assert that the result of getName is null.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion verifies that the default state of the name field is null, which is the expected behavior when it has not been explicitly set.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: This test is important to ensure that the class correctly handles uninitialized states and that the getName method accurately reflects the state of the name field.
Scenario 2: Retrieving a non-null name
Details:
  TestName: getNameReturnsCorrectValueWhenSet
  Description: This test checks that the getName method returns the correct name when the name field has been explicitly set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set the name field to a non-null value.
  Act: Invoke the getName method on the created instance.
  Assert: Assert that the result of getName is equal to the value that was set.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion verifies that the getName method accurately retrieves the value of the name field when it has been set.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: This test confirms that the getName method functions correctly in typical use cases where the name field is expected to hold a valid string.
Scenario 3: Retrieving the name after changing its value
Details:
  TestName: getNameReflectsLatestValueAfterUpdate
  Description: This test ensures that the getName method returns the most recent value after the name has been updated.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class, set the name field to an initial value, and then update it to a new value.
  Act: Invoke the getName method on the created instance.
  Assert: Assert that the result of getName is equal to the new value that was set after the update.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion checks that the getName method returns the latest value of the name field after it has been updated, ensuring that the field is not immutable.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: This test is significant to verify that the class allows dynamic updates to the name field and that such updates are accurately reflected when retrieving the value through getName.
Scenario 4: Retrieving the name in a concurrent environment
Details:
  TestName: getNameIsThreadSafe
  Description: This test checks that the getName method can be safely called from multiple threads without causing any data corruption or race conditions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set the name field. Start multiple threads that will call the getName method concurrently.
  Act: Execute the threads and retrieve the name in each of them.
  Assert: Assert that all threads receive the same name value and that no exceptions or errors occur during execution.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion checks that concurrent access to the getName method does not lead to inconsistent results or concurrency issues.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: This test is important for applications that will access the class instances from multiple threads, ensuring that the getName method is thread-safe and behaves predictably in a concurrent environment.
