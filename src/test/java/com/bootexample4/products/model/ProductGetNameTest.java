Scenario 1: Retrieving name when it is set

Details:
  TestName: getNameWhenSet
  Description: This test checks if the getName method correctly returns the name of the entity when it has been explicitly set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the entity class and use a public setter method or reflection to set the 'name' field to a non-null value.
  Act: Invoke the getName method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the result of getName is equal to the value that was set.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getName method retrieves the correct name value that was set. This is important to ensure that the entity's name can be retrieved as expected when it has been initialized.

Scenario 2: Retrieving default name when not set

Details:
  TestName: getNameWhenNotSet
  Description: This test checks if the getName method returns null or a default value when the name has not been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the entity class without setting the 'name' field.
  Act: Invoke the getName method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the result of getName is null or a default value defined by the business logic.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the getName method returns null when the name has not been initialized. This test is crucial to ensure that the method handles uninitialized states according to the application's requirements.

Scenario 3: Retrieving name after setting it to an empty string

Details:
  TestName: getNameWhenEmpty
  Description: This test verifies that the getName method returns an empty string if the name field has been set to an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the entity class and set the 'name' field to an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the getName method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the result of getName is an empty string.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the getName method accurately reflects an empty string when that is the value set for the name. This test is significant for validating that the method can handle empty values without errors.

Scenario 4: Retrieving name after setting it to a very long string

Details:
  TestName: getNameWhenLongString
  Description: This test ensures that the getName method can handle and return very long string values without truncation or errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the entity class and set the 'name' field to a very long string.
  Act: Invoke the getName method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the result of getName is equal to the long string value that was set.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the getName method can manage and return large strings, which is essential for ensuring that the method can handle a wide range of input sizes.

Scenario 5: Retrieving name in a concurrent environment

Details:
  TestName: getNameConcurrently
  Description: This test checks if the getName method can be safely called by multiple threads concurrently without causing any race conditions or errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the entity class and set the 'name' field. Start multiple threads that call the getName method on the same instance.
  Act: Execute all threads and retrieve the name concurrently.
  Assert: Assert that each thread receives the correct name value and no exceptions are thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getName method is thread-safe and can be used concurrently without data corruption or synchronization issues. This is important for multi-threaded applications to ensure consistent behavior.
