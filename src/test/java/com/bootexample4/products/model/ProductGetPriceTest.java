Scenario 1: Retrieve Price of a Default Product

Details:
  TestName: getPriceOfDefaultProduct
  Description: This test aims to verify that the getPrice method returns a default value for a new Product instance that has not had its price set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Product instance without setting the price.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method on the new Product instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned price is 0.0, representing the default double value.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the default value for a double field is correctly returned as 0.0 when the price is not explicitly set. This is significant as it reflects the initial state of the Product object regarding its price attribute.

Scenario 2: Retrieve Price After Setting a Positive Value

Details:
  TestName: getPriceAfterSettingPositiveValue
  Description: This test ensures that the getPrice method returns the correct price after it has been set to a positive value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product instance and set its price to a positive value using the setPrice method.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method on the Product instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned price matches the value set previously.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the setPrice method correctly updates the price and getPrice retrieves the updated value. This is important for ensuring that product pricing logic works as expected.

Scenario 3: Retrieve Price After Setting to Zero

Details:
  TestName: getPriceAfterSettingToZero
  Description: This test verifies that the getPrice method can return a price of 0.0, which may represent a free or promotional product.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product instance and set its price to 0.0 using the setPrice method.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method on the Product instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned price is 0.0.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the price can be explicitly set to 0.0 and retrieved, which is significant for scenarios where products might be offered for free or as part of a promotion.

Scenario 4: Retrieve Price After Setting a Negative Value

Details:
  TestName: getPriceAfterSettingNegativeValue
  Description: This test checks the behavior of getPrice when the price has been set to a negative value, which might not be a valid scenario in a real-world application.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product instance and set its price to a negative value using the setPrice method.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method on the Product instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned price is the negative value that was set.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getPrice method returns the exact value set, even if it is negative. This test is important to identify potential issues with input validation or business logic that should prevent negative pricing.

Scenario 5: Retrieve Price After Setting to a Large Value

Details:
  TestName: getPriceAfterSettingLargeValue
  Description: This test ensures that the getPrice method can handle and return large values, which may be necessary for high-priced products.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product instance and set its price to a very large positive value using the setPrice method.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method on the Product instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned price matches the large value set previously.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the setPrice and getPrice methods can handle large values, which is significant for ensuring the application can manage products with a wide range of prices.

Scenario 6: Retrieve Price After Multiple Updates

Details:
  TestName: getPriceAfterMultipleUpdates
  Description: This test checks that the getPrice method returns the most recent price after multiple updates to the price.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product instance and update its price several times using the setPrice method.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method on the Product instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned price matches the last value set.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the getPrice method reflects the most current price, which is significant for applications where product prices may change frequently and need to reflect the latest updates.
