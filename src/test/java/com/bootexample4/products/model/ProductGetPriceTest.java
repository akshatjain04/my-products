Scenario 1: Retrieving Default Price Value

Details:
  TestName: getPriceShouldReturnDefault
  Description: This test verifies that the getPrice method returns the default price value when the price has not been explicitly set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class without setting the price.
  Act: Call the getPrice method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned price is 0.0, which is the default value for a double field.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the uninitialized price field returns the default double value of 0.0. This is significant as it ensures that the getPrice method behaves correctly even when the price has not been initialized.

Scenario 2: Retrieving Set Price Value

Details:
  TestName: getPriceShouldReturnSetValue
  Description: This test is meant to check that the getPrice method returns the correct price value after it has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set the price to a specific value.
  Act: Call the getPrice method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned price matches the value that was set.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that getPrice accurately retrieves the price that was explicitly set. The significance of this test is to confirm that the method reflects the current state of the object and returns accurate data.

Scenario 3: Retrieving Price After Update

Details:
  TestName: getPriceShouldReflectUpdatedValue
  Description: This test checks that the getPrice method returns an updated price after the price has been changed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class, set the price, and then update it to a new value.
  Act: Call the getPrice method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned price is equal to the updated value.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getPrice method returns the latest price value. It is crucial for ensuring that the state of the object is consistent and that the getPrice method returns the most recent data.

Scenario 4: Price Persistence Check

Details:
  TestName: getPriceShouldBePersistent
  Description: This test ensures that the price value retrieved by getPrice is persistent across multiple calls.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set the price to a specific value.
  Act: Call the getPrice method on the instance multiple times.
  Assert: Assert that all calls to getPrice return the same value.
Validation:
  The assertion checks for data persistence, confirming that the price value does not change between calls if it has not been explicitly modified. This is significant for the reliability and predictability of the getPrice method.

Scenario 5: Price Precision Check

Details:
  TestName: getPriceShouldHandlePrecision
  Description: This test verifies that the getPrice method can handle and return prices with high precision.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set the price to a value with high precision (e.g., 10.1234567).
  Act: Call the getPrice method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned price matches the high precision value that was set.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method can accurately handle and return double values with high precision, which is significant for financial calculations where precision is crucial.

Note: The above scenarios assume that the class containing the getPrice method has appropriate setters or constructors to set the price, and that it is a JPA entity based on the provided import statements.
