Scenario 1: Verify the getPrice method returns the correct product price.

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsCorrectPrice.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns the correct price of the product.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product object and set a specific price using the setPrice method.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method on the Product object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned price against the price set in the arrange step.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getPrice method correctly returns the price set for the product. This is important to ensure accurate product pricing information is provided.

Scenario 2: Verify the getPrice method returns 0 for a newly created Product.

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceForNewProduct.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns 0 for a product that has not had its price set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Product object without setting a price.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method on the Product object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned price against 0.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getPrice method correctly returns 0 for a product with no price set. This is important to ensure that newly created products default to a price of 0.

Scenario 3: Verify the getPrice method returns the correct price after changing the product's price.

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceAfterPriceChange.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns the updated price after the product's price has been changed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product object and set a specific price. Then, change the price to a different value using the setPrice method.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method on the Product object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned price against the new price set in the arrange step.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getPrice method correctly returns the updated price after a price change. This is important to ensure accurate product pricing information is maintained.

Scenario 4: Verify the getPrice method returns the correct price for a product with a negative price.

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceForNegativePrice.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns the correct price for a product with a negative price.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product object and set a negative price using the setPrice method.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method on the Product object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned price against the negative price set in the arrange step.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getPrice method correctly returns the negative price set for the product. This is important to ensure the method can handle negative prices, even though they are not typical in a real-world scenario.
