Scenario 1: Retrieving the default price value when not set

Details:
  TestName: getPriceWhenNotSet
  Description: This test will verify that the getPrice method returns the default value of the price field when it has not been explicitly set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the entity class without setting the price.
  Act: Call the getPrice method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned price is 0.0, which is the default value for a double field.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getPrice method correctly handles the scenario where the price has not been set, reflecting the default behavior of uninitialized double fields in Java.
  This test is significant as it ensures that the method behaves as expected in the absence of an explicitly set price value.

Scenario 2: Retrieving the price after setting a positive value

Details:
  TestName: getPriceAfterSettingPositiveValue
  Description: This test checks whether the getPrice method returns the correct price value after it has been set to a positive double value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the entity class and set the price to a positive double value.
  Act: Call the getPrice method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned price matches the value that was set.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the getPrice method accurately retrieves the price that was previously set, confirming that the field is properly stored and accessed.
  This test is important to confirm that the method works as intended when the price is a positive value.

Scenario 3: Retrieving the price after setting it to zero

Details:
  TestName: getPriceAfterSettingToZero
  Description: This test aims to confirm that the getPrice method is capable of returning a price of zero if it has been explicitly set to this value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the entity class and set the price to 0.0.
  Act: Call the getPrice method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned price is 0.0.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the getPrice method can handle a price explicitly set to zero, which is a valid case for many business scenarios.
  This test is crucial to ensure that the method is capable of handling edge cases correctly, such as items that are free or services that have no cost.

Scenario 4: Retrieving the price after setting a negative value

Details:
  TestName: getPriceAfterSettingNegativeValue
  Description: This test will determine if the getPrice method can return a negative price value, which might represent a credit or refund situation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the entity class and set the price to a negative double value.
  Act: Call the getPrice method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned price is the negative value that was set.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getPrice method correctly handles negative values, which could be used to represent deductions or credits in some business logic.
  This test is essential to ensure that the method can handle all valid double values, including negative ones.

Scenario 5: Retrieving the price in a concurrent environment

Details:
  TestName: getPriceInConcurrentEnvironment
  Description: This test will check whether the getPrice method returns a consistent value even when accessed from multiple threads, potentially simulating a high-traffic e-commerce scenario.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the entity class and set the price to a specific value. Start multiple threads that will call the getPrice method on the same instance.
  Act: Execute all threads and retrieve the price from each.
  Assert: Assert that all threads return the same price value.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that getPrice method is thread-safe and returns consistent results when accessed concurrently.
  This test is significant as it validates that the method can be safely used in a multi-threaded environment, which is typical for web applications.
