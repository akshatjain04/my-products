```
Scenario 1: Retrieve price when it is set to a positive value

Details:
  TestName: getPriceWhenSetToPositiveValue
  Description: This test verifies that the getPrice method correctly returns the price of the product when it has been previously set to a positive value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Product and set its price to a positive value using setPrice.
  Act: Call the getPrice method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned price is equal to the value set.
Validation:
  The assertion validates that the getPrice method retrieves the correct price value that was set. This is essential to ensure that the product's price information is accurately maintained and retrievable.

Scenario 2: Retrieve price when it is set to zero

Details:
  TestName: getPriceWhenSetToZero
  Description: This test checks the getPrice method's ability to return a price of zero, which could represent a free product or a product with no cost.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Product and set its price to zero using setPrice.
  Act: Call the getPrice method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned price is zero.
Validation:
  This assertion ensures that the getPrice method can handle edge case scenarios, such as a product being free or part of a promotion, without misrepresenting the price.

Scenario 3: Retrieve price when it has not been set

Details:
  TestName: getPriceWhenNotSet
  Description: This test ensures that the getPrice method returns a default value (typically 0.0) when the price has not been explicitly set for a Product instance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of Product without setting the price.
  Act: Call the getPrice method on the new instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned price is equal to the default value for double data types (0.0).
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the getPrice method correctly handles uninitialized prices. This is important for new Product instances where the price may not have been set yet.

Scenario 4: Retrieve price when it is set to a negative value

Details:
  TestName: getPriceWhenSetToNegativeValue
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the getPrice method when the price is set to a negative value, which might not be a valid scenario for a product's price.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Product and set its price to a negative value using setPrice.
  Act: Call the getPrice method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned price is the negative value that was set.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the getPrice method does not alter negative values. This test may highlight the need for additional validation to prevent negative pricing in the business logic.
