Scenario 1: Retrieving the default null name
Details:  
  TestName: getNameReturnsNullWhenNotSet
  Description: This test checks that the getName method returns null when the name has not been initialized or set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class without setting the name field.
  Act: Invoke the getName method on the created instance.
  Assert: Assert that the result of getName is null.
Validation: 
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion verifies that the default state of the name field is null, which is the expected behavior when it has not been explicitly set.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensures that the class correctly handles the default state of the name property, which can be important for understanding how instances of the class behave when newly created.
Scenario 2: Retrieving a non-null name
Details:  
  TestName: getNameReturnsCorrectValueWhenSet
  Description: This test checks that the getName method returns the correct string value that has been set for the name field.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set the name field to a non-null String value.
  Act: Invoke the getName method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the result of getName is the String value that was set.
Validation: 
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion verifies that the getName method returns the exact value that was assigned to the name field, ensuring the getter method's accuracy.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: This test confirms that the getName method functions correctly when retrieving the name of an entity, which is critical for any operation that requires the entity's name.
Scenario 3: Handling of name after entity persistence
Details:  
  TestName: getNamePersistsAfterEntitySaved
  Description: This test verifies that the name of the entity remains consistent after the entity has been saved and persisted, given that the class seems to be an entity class due to the presence of JPA annotations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the entity class, set the name, and simulate saving the entity to the database (using a mock if necessary).
  Act: Retrieve the name using getName after the simulated save operation.
  Assert: Assert that the name retrieved is the same as the one set before saving the entity.
Validation: 
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion checks that the entity's name is not altered during the persistence process.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: This test is important to ensure data integrity and consistency across the lifecycle of the entity, especially after database operations.
Scenario 4: Name field access without direct modification
Details:  
  TestName: nameFieldIsInaccessibleDirectlyDueToPrivateAccess
  Description: This test ensures that the name field cannot be accessed or modified directly due to its private access modifier, ensuring encapsulation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Attempt to access the name field directly from an instance of the class.
  Act: Compilation should fail due to access restrictions.
  Assert: Not applicable since this is a compilation-time check.
Validation: 
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: This scenario doesn't involve a runtime assertion but ensures at compile time that the name field is not directly accessible, which is expected due to the private access modifier.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: This scenario is significant for maintaining the encapsulation principle of the class, ensuring that the state of the object can only be manipulated through its public interface.
