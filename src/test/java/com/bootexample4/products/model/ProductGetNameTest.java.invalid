Scenario 1: Retrieving Null Name Value
Details:  
  TestName: getNameWhenNull
  Description: This test verifies that the getName method returns null when the name field has not been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class with the name field set to null.
  Act: Call the getName method on the instance.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is null.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks for a null return value, which is expected because the name field was initialized with a null value. This test is important to ensure that the method correctly handles null values.
Scenario 2: Retrieving Non-Null Name Value
Details:  
  TestName: getNameWhenNotNull
  Description: This test confirms that the getName method returns the correct non-null String value when the name field is set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class and set the name field to a non-null String value.
  Act: Call the getName method on the instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value matches the String value set for the name field.
Validation: 
  The assertion validates that the getName method returns the exact string that was set for the name field. This test ensures that the method correctly retrieves the name value from the object's state.
Scenario 3: Verifying Entity Annotation Handling
Details:  
  TestName: getNameWithEntityAnnotation
  Description: This test checks whether the getName method functions correctly when the class is annotated as an Entity, which may involve additional processing by the JPA provider.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class which is annotated with @Entity and set the name field to a specific String value.
  Act: Call the getName method on the entity instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value matches the String value set for the name field.
Validation: 
  The assertion ensures that the getName method is unaffected by the class being treated as an entity by JPA. This test is significant in the context of JPA and ORM frameworks that may enhance or proxy entities.
Scenario 4: Concurrent Access to Name Field
Details:  
  TestName: getNameUnderConcurrentAccess
  Description: This test ensures that the getName method returns a consistent value when accessed by multiple threads simultaneously, which may be relevant if the entity is shared across threads.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class and set the name field to a specific String value. Simulate concurrent access by spawning multiple threads that call the getName method.
  Act: Each thread calls the getName method on the shared instance.
  Assert: Confirm that all threads receive the same String value for the name field.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks for consistent results across all threads, which is vital for thread safety. This test is significant if the entity is accessed concurrently in a multi-threaded environment.
Scenario 5: Integrity After Id Generation
Details:  
  TestName: getNameAfterIdGeneration
  Description: This test checks that the getName method still returns the correct name value after the id field has been automatically generated, ensuring that auto-generation does not impact other fields.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class, set the name field, and simulate the id field's auto-generation as if the entity has been persisted.
  Act: Call the getName method on the instance.
  Assert: Confirm that the returned name value is still correct post-id generation.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the auto-generation of the id field (marked with @Id and @GeneratedValue) does not interfere with the retrieval of the name value. This test ensures the integrity of the entity's fields after persistence operations.
