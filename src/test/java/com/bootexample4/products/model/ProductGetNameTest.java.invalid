Scenario 1: Retrieving the default null name
Details:  
  TestName: getNameReturnsNullWhenNotSet
  Description: This test checks that the getName method returns null when the name has not been initialized or set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class without setting the name field.
  Act: Invoke the getName method on the created instance.
  Assert: Assert that the result of getName is null.
Validation: 
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test ensures that the default state of the name field is null and that getName accurately reflects this state when the name has not been explicitly set.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: It's important to confirm that the class correctly handles uninitialized fields, as this may be a common state in the application's lifecycle.
Scenario 2: Retrieving the non-null name
Details:  
  TestName: getNameReturnsCorrectValueWhenSet
  Description: This test checks that the getName method returns the correct String value that has been set for the name field.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set the name field to a known String value.
  Act: Invoke the getName method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the result of getName matches the String value that was set.
Validation: 
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test ensures that getName accurately retrieves the value of the name when it has been initialized.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensuring that the getName method correctly returns the name value is crucial for the application's functionality, where the name is displayed or processed.
Scenario 3: Retrieving name after updating it
Details:  
  TestName: getNameReflectsUpdatedValue
  Description: This test ensures that the getName method returns the updated String value after the name field has been changed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class, set the name field to an initial value, then update it to a new value.
  Act: Invoke the getName method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the result of getName matches the new updated value.
Validation: 
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test verifies that getName returns the latest value of the name field after it has been updated.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: It's essential to confirm that the getName method reflects the current state of the name field, especially after updates, as this impacts data consistency throughout the application.
Scenario 4: Consistency of getName result
Details:  
  TestName: getNameResultConsistency
  Description: This test checks that consecutive invocations of the getName method return the same result, assuming no modifications to the name field in between calls.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set the name field to a known String value.
  Act: Invoke the getName method twice on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that both invocations return the same result.
Validation: 
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test ensures that getName provides a consistent result across multiple calls when the state of the object does not change.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Consistency in method results is vital for reliability, particularly when the method is used in various parts of the application that rely on stable data.
