Scenario 1: Retrieving Uninitialized Name
Details:  
  TestName: getNameWhenUninitialized
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the getName method when the name field has not been initialized and is expected to return null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the object of the class without setting the name field.
  Act: Invoke the getName method on the object.
  Assert: Assert that the result is null.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getName method correctly returns null when the name field is uninitialized. This is significant because it confirms the method's ability to handle uninitialized state gracefully.
Scenario 2: Retrieving Initialized Name
Details:  
  TestName: getNameWhenInitialized
  Description: This test ensures that the getName method returns the correct value of the name field when it has been initialized.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the object of the class and set the name field to a known value.
  Act: Invoke the getName method on the object.
  Assert: Assert that the result matches the known value set for the name field.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the getName method correctly retrieves the value of the name field when it is initialized. This test is crucial to confirm that the method accurately reflects the current state of the object.
Scenario 3: Name Field Persistence Mapping
Details:  
  TestName: getNamePersistenceMapping
  Description: This test verifies that the name field is correctly mapped and retrieved, considering the class is annotated as an Entity and the field might be managed by a persistence context.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the persistence context and simulate the loading of an entity where the name field is set to a known value.
  Act: Invoke the getName method on the mocked entity.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the known value set in the mocked persistence context.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the name field is correctly mapped and managed by the persistence context, which is essential for the correct behavior of the class as a JPA Entity.
Scenario 4: Name Field Consistency After Update
Details:  
  TestName: getNameAfterUpdate
  Description: This test checks whether the getName method returns the updated value after the name field has been changed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the object of the class, set the name field to an initial value, then update it to a new value.
  Act: Invoke the getName method on the object after the update.
  Assert: Assert that the result reflects the new value.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getName method returns the most recent value of the name field, which is important to ensure data consistency within the object.
Scenario 5: Concurrent Access to Name Field
Details:  
  TestName: getNameWithConcurrentAccess
  Description: This test assesses the thread-safety of the getName method when accessed concurrently, which may be relevant if the class instances are shared across threads.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create multiple threads that access the getName method on a shared object instance.
  Act: Start all threads and wait for their completion.
  Assert: Assert that all threads retrieve the correct value of the name field without any data corruption.
Validation:
  The assertion checks for the thread-safety of the getName method, which is crucial in a concurrent environment to prevent data races and ensure consistent behavior.
