Scenario 1: Retrieving Null Name Value

Details:  
  TestName: getNameWhenNameIsNull
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the getName method when the name field is null, which is its default state before any value is set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with all fields set to their default values, which implies the name field is null.
  Act: Call the getName method on the created instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is null.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly returns a null value when the name field has not been initialized. This test is significant as it checks the method's ability to handle default uninitialized states.

Scenario 2: Retrieving Non-Null Name Value

Details:  
  TestName: getNameWhenNameIsSet
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the getName method when the name field has been set to a non-null value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set the name field to a non-null value using a setter or constructor if available.
  Act: Call the getName method on the created instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is equal to the value that was set.
Validation: 
  The assertion validates that the getName method returns the correct name value that was explicitly set. This test is crucial as it confirms the method's ability to retrieve the proper value, which is a common operation in the application.

Scenario 3: Retrieving Name After Entity Persistence

Details:  
  TestName: getNameAfterEntityPersistence
  Description: This test ensures that the getName method returns the correct name value after the entity has been persisted and possibly retrieved from the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Persist an instance of the class with a non-null name value to the database and retrieve it.
  Act: Call the getName method on the retrieved instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is equal to the value that was persisted.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that the getName method works correctly in a full persistence context, which includes saving and retrieving the entity. This test is important to ensure that the JPA Entity behavior is as expected and that the name field is correctly managed by the persistence framework.

Scenario 4: Retrieving Name After Serialization and Deserialization

Details:  
  TestName: getNameAfterSerialization
  Description: This test checks if the getName method returns the correct name value after the object has been serialized and deserialized, which can be a common operation when using distributed systems.
Execution:
  Arrange: Serialize an instance of the class with a non-null name to a byte stream and then deserialize it back to an object.
  Act: Call the getName method on the deserialized instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is equal to the value before serialization.
Validation: 
  The assertion ensures that the class's serialization and deserialization mechanisms do not alter the name field. This is important to confirm for classes that are intended to be transmitted over a network or stored in a serialized form.

Scenario 5: Retrieving Name in a Multi-threaded Environment

Details:  
  TestName: getNameInMultithreadedContext
  Description: This test validates that the getName method returns the correct name value when accessed by multiple threads, which could potentially reveal synchronization issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with a non-null name value. Access the getName method concurrently from multiple threads.
  Act: Each thread calls the getName method.
  Assert: Assert that all threads receive the same name value that was initially set.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks for thread safety when accessing the name field. This test is critical in a multi-threaded application to ensure that shared data is correctly handled without introducing race conditions or visibility issues.
