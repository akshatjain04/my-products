Scenario 1: Setting a Valid Product ID
Details:
  TestName: setValidProductId
  Description: This test is meant to check if the setId method correctly sets the product ID when a valid long value is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product object and a long value representing a valid product ID.
  Act: Invoke the setId method of the Product object, passing the valid product ID as parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the product ID of the Product object matches the provided value.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the setId method correctly sets the product ID when a valid value is provided. The test is significant as it ensures the correct functionality of the setId method which is crucial for product identification in the application.

Scenario 2: Setting a Null Product ID
Details:
  TestName: setNullProductId
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the setId method when a null value is provided as product ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product object.
  Act: Invoke the setId method of the Product object, passing null as parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the product ID of the Product object is null.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the setId method appropriately handles the scenario when a null value is provided as product ID. The test is significant as it checks the robustness of the method against null inputs.

Scenario 3: Setting a Negative Product ID
Details:
  TestName: setNegativeProductId
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the setId method when a negative long value is provided as product ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product object and a long value representing a negative product ID.
  Act: Invoke the setId method of the Product object, passing the negative product ID as parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the product ID of the Product object matches the provided negative value.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the setId method correctly sets the product ID even when a negative value is provided. The test is significant as it checks the method's handling of negative inputs, which might not be valid in the context of product identification.

Scenario 4: Resetting Product ID
Details:
  TestName: resetProductId
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the setId method when it is invoked a second time to change the product ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product object and two long values representing different product IDs.
  Act: Invoke the setId method of the Product object twice, passing the two different product IDs as parameters in turn.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the product ID of the Product object matches the second provided value.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the setId method correctly updates the product ID when invoked a second time. The test is significant as it checks the method's ability to change the product ID, which might be required in scenarios such as product ID corrections or updates.
