The "Unable to access jarfile /usr/local/karate.jar" error is not directly related to the Gherkin feature file itself, but rather suggests either a problem with the environment setup or file configuration. To address this, ensure Karate is correctly installed or referenced in your project, and verify the path to the `karate.jar` file.

Regardless, let's proceed with auditing and fixing the provided Gherkin feature file based on the specified instructions. Below is the corrected and audited feature file.

```gherkin
Feature: Test Nobel Laureates API Endpoint

  Background:
    """ 
    Define base URL for the API
    """
    * def urlBase = karate.properties['NOBEL_API_HOST']
    * url urlBase

  Scenario Outline: Obtain Laureates Information with Valid Query Parameters
    Given path '2.1/laureates'
    And param offset = <offset>
    And param limit = <limit>
    And param sort = <sort>
    When method GET
    Then status 200
    And match response.laureates == '#[]'
    And match response.laureates[*].id == '#number'
    And match response.laureates[*].laureateIfPerson.gender == '#string'
    And match response.laureates[*].laureateIfPerson.birth.date == '#string'
    And match response.meta.offset == <offset>
    And match response.meta.limit == <limit>
    And match response.meta.sort == <sort>

    Examples:
    | offset | limit | sort   |
    | 1      | 5     | 'asc'  |
    |   Etc
